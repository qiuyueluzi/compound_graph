We prove theorems describing the basic properties of these functors. We introduce also constant functions and converse of a function. The recent concept is defined for an arbitrary function, however is meaningful in the case of functions which range is a subset of a Cartesian product of two sets. Then the converse of a function has the same domain as the function itself and assigns to an element of the domain the mirror image of the ordered pair assigned by the function. In the case of functions defined on a non-empty set we redefine the above mentioned functors and prove simplified versions of theorems proved in the general case. We prove also theorems stating relationships between introduced concepts and such properties of binary operations as commutativity or associativity.",

We feel free to use any standard set-theoretic notation without explicit use of indices'' \\cite[p.~97]{Tar-Wir1}. The aim of this work was to check the feasibility of such approach in Mizar. It works.\\par Let us observe some peculiarities: \\begin{itemize} \\item[-] empty set (i.e. the many sorted set with empty set of indices) belongs to itself (theorem 133), \\item[-] we get two different inclusions $X \\subseteq Y$ iff $\\forall_{i \\in I} X_i \\subseteq Y_i$ and $X \\sqsubseteq Y$ iff $\\forall_x x \\in X \\Rightarrow x \\in Y$ equivalent only for sets that yield non empty values. \\end{itemize} Therefore the care is advised.",

            "summary": "This is an experimental article which shows that logical correctness of logic circuits can be easily proven by the Mizar system. First, we define the notion of logic gates. Then we prove that an MSB carry of `4 Bit Carry Skip Adder' is equivalent to an MSB carry of a normal 4 bit adder. In the last theorem, we show that outputs of the `4 Bit Carry Look Ahead Adder' are equivalent to the corresponding outputs of the normal 4 bits adder. The policy here is as follows: when the functional (semantic) correctness of a system is already proven, and the correspondence of the system to a (normal) logic circuit is given, it is enough to prove the correctness of the new circuit if we only prove the logical equivalence between them. Although the article is very fundamental (it contains few environment files), it can be applied to real problems. The key of the method introduced here is to put the specification of the logic circuit into the Mizar propositional formulae, and to use the strong inference ability of the Mizar checker. The proof is done formally so that the automation of the proof writing is possible. Even in the 5.3.07 version of Mizar, it can handle a formulae of more than 100 lines, and a formula which contains more than 100 variables. This means that the Mizar system is enough to prove logical correctness of middle scaled logic circuits.",

Most of them we prove in two versions depending on which requirement is fulfilled. In the second part we deal with the union of finite sets that enjoys mentioned above properties. We prove analogs of the theorems proved in the first part. We precede the main part of the article with auxiliary theorems related to boolean properties of sets, enumerated sets, finite subsets, and functions. We define a casting function that yields to a set the empty set typed as a finite subset of the set. We prove also two schemes of the induction on finite sets.",

These definitions satisfy all the axioms for a field. $0_{\\Bbb C} = 0+0i$ and $1_{\\Bbb C} = 1+0i$ are identities for addition and multiplication respectively, and there are multiplicative inverses for each non zero element in $\\Bbb C$. The difference and division of complex numbers are also defined. We do not interpret the set of all real numbers $\\Bbb R$ as a subset of $\\Bbb C$. From here on we do not abandon the ordered pair notation for complex numbers. For example: $i^2 = (0+1i)^2 = -1+0i \\neq -1$.

The proof of the sufficiency is by induction on the number of elements of $D$. A.~M\\c{a}kowski and K.~Wi{\\'s}niewski \\cite{maw69} have shown that the assumption of finiteness is superfluous. They proved their version of the theorem for $f$ being a function from $D$ into $D$. In the proof, the required partition was constructed and the construction used the axiom of choice. Their main point was to demonstrate that the use of this axiom in the proof is essential. We have proved in Mizar the generalized version of Abian's theorem, i.e. without assuming finiteness of $D$. We have simplified the proof from \\cite{maw69} which uses well-ordering principle and transfinite ordinals---our proof does not use these notions but otherwise is based on their idea (we employ choice functions).",

Next, we define \"The First Order Cutting Relation of two sets A,B under a subset of the set A\" as the union of images of elements of this subset under the relation. We also define \"The Second Order Cutting Subset of the Cartesian Product of two sets A,B under a subset of the set A\" as an intersection of images of elements of this subset under the subset of the cartesian product. The paper also defines first and second projection of binary relations. The main goal of the article is to prove properties and collocations of introduced definitions in this paper. The numbers written in parenthesis after the label of theorems correspond to the numbers of expressions contained in the original article.",

The formalization of the notion as classical as the Lebesgue measure determines the powers of the PC Mizar system as a tool for the strict, precise notation and verification of the correctness of deductive theories. Following the successive articles \\cite{SUPINF_1.ABS}, \\cite{SUPINF_2.ABS}, \\cite{MEASURE1.ABS}, \\cite{MEASURE6.ABS} constructed so that the final one should include the definition and the basic properties of the Lebesgue measure, we observe one of the paths relatively simple in the sense of the definition, enabling us the formal introduction of this notion. This way, although toilsome, since such is the nature of formal theories, is greatly instructive. It brings home the proper succession of the introduction of the definitions of intermediate notions and points out to those elements of the theory which determine the essence of the complexity of the notion being introduced.\\par The paper includes the definition of the $\\sigma$-field of Lebesgue measurable sets, the definition of the Lebesgue measure and the basic set of the theorems describing its properties.",

            "summary": "Non overwriting program is a program where each variable used in it is written only just one time, but the control variables used for ``for-statement'' are exceptional. Contrarily, variables are allowed to be read many times. There are other restrictions for the non overwriting program. For statements, only the following are allowed: ``substituting-statement'', ``if-else-statement'', ``for-statement'' (with break and without break), function (correct one) -- ``call-statement'' and ``return-statement''. Grammar of non overwriting program is like the one of the C-language. For type of variables, ``int'', ``real\", ``char'' and ``float'' can be used, and array of them can also be used. For operation, ``+'', ``$-$'' and ``*'' are used for a type ``int''; ``+'', ``$-$'', ``*'' and ``/'' are used for a type ``float''. User can also define structures like in C. Non overwriting program can be translated to (predicative) logic formula in definition part to define functions. If a new function is correctly defined, a corresponding program is correct, if it does not use arrays. If it uses arrays, area check is necessary in the following theorem.\\par Semantic correctness is shown by some theorems following the definition. These theorems must tie up the result of the program and mathematical concepts introduced before. Correctness is proven {\\it function-wise}. We must use only {\\it correctness-proven} functions to define a new function (to write a new program as a form of a function). Here, we present two programs of division function of two natural numbers and of two integers. An algorithm is checked for each case by proving correctness of the definitions. We also perform an area check of the index of arrays used in one of the programs.",

That theory works with universal class which consists of all sets and every class is a subclass of it.

The sets are introduced in \\cite{CLASSES2.ABS} and some concepts of MK are modeled. The concepts are: the class $On$ of all ordinal numbers belonging to the universe, subclasses, transfinite sequences of non-empty elements of universe, etc. The reflection theorem states that if $A_\\xi$ is an increasing and continuous transfinite sequence of non-empty sets and class $A = \\bigcup_{\\xi \\in On} A_\\xi$, then for every formula $H$ there is a strictly increasing continuous mapping $F: On \\to On$ such that if $\\varkappa$ is a critical number of $F$ (i.e. $F(\\varkappa) = \\varkappa > 0$) and $f \\in A_\\varkappa^{\\bf VAR}$, then $A,f\\models H \\equiv\\ {A_\\varkappa},f\\models H$.

The formulation that we adopt in this paper is very useful not only to formalize the calculus but also to do a number of logics with essentially propositional character. In addition, it is much simpler than the past formalization for modal logic. In the first section, we give the mentioned formulation which the author heavily owes to the formalism of Adam Grabowski's \\cite{HILBERT1.ABS}. After the theoretical development of the logic, we prove a number of valid formulas of IPC in the sections 2--4. The last two sections are devoted to present classical propositional calculus and modal calculus S4 in our framework, as a preparation for future study. In the forthcoming Part II of this paper, we shall prove, among others, a number of intuitionistically valid formulas with negation.",

A section of $D_{H}(a)$ determined by $f$ (symbolically $S_{H}(a,f)$) and a notion of predicative closure of a class are defined. It is proved that if following assumptions are satisfied: (o) $A=\\bigcup_{\\xi}A_{\\xi}$, (i) $A_{\\xi} \\subset A_{\\eta}$ for $\\xi < \\eta$, (ii) $A_{\\lambda}=\\bigcup_{\\xi<\\lambda}A_{\\lambda}$ ($\\lambda$ is a limit number), (iii) $A_{\\xi}\\in A$, (iv) $A_{\\xi}$ is transitive, (v) $(x,y\\in A) \\rightarrow (x\\cap y\\in A)$, (vi) $A$ is predicatively closed, then the axiom of power sets and the axiom of substitution are valid in $A$. The second part is continuation of \\cite{ZF_FUND1.ABS}. It is proved that if a non-void, transitive class is closed with respect to the operations $A_{1}-A_{7}$ then it is predicatively closed. At last sufficient criteria for a class to be a model of ZF-theory are formulated: if $A_{\\xi}$ satisfies o -- iv and $A$ is closed under the operations $A_{1}-A_{7}$ then $A$ is a model of ZF.",

We mean by similar formulas the two formulas that differs only in the names of bound variables. Some authors (compare \\cite{RASIOWA-SIKOR}) call such formulas {\\em congruent}. We use the word {\\em similar} following \\cite{POGO:1}, \\cite{POGO:2}, \\cite{POGORZELSKI.1975}. The concept is unjustfully neglected in many logical handbooks. It is intuitively quite clear, however the exact definition is not simple. As far as we know, only W.A.~Pogorzelski and T.~Prucnal \\cite{POGORZELSKI.1975} define it in the precise way. We follow basically the Pogorzelski's definition (compare \\cite{POGO:1}). We define renumeration of bound variables and we say that two formulas are similar if after renumeration are equal. Therefore we need a rule of chosing bound variables independent of the original choice. Quite obvious solution is to use consecutively variables $x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\\dots$, where $k$ is the maximal index of free variable occurring in the formula. Therefore after the renumeration we get the new formula in which different quantifiers bind different variables. It is the reason that the result of renumeration applied to a formula $\\varphi$ we call {\\em $\\varphi$ with variables separated}.",

The completeness theorem provides the theoretical basis for a uniform formalization of mathematics as in the Mizar project. We formalize first-order logic up to the completeness theorem as in H. D. Ebbinghaus, J. Flum, and W. Thomas, Mathematical Logic, 1984, Springer Verlag New York Inc. The present article contains the proof of a simplified completeness theorem for a countable relational language without equality.",

Following redefinitions have been made: singleton of a set as a family in the topological space and results of boolean operations on families as a family of the topological space. Notion of a family of complements of sets and a closed (open) family have been also introduced. Next some theorems refer to subspaces in a topological space: some facts about types in a subspace, theorems about open and closed sets and families in a subspace. A notion of restriction of a family has been also introduced and basic properties of this notion have been proved. The last part of the article is about mappings. There are proved necessary and sufficient conditions for a mapping to be continuous. A notion of homeomorphism has been defined next. Theorems about homeomorphisms of topological spaces have been also proved.",

First a loop structure $\\langle G, 0, +\\rangle$ is defined and six axioms corresponding to it are given. Group is defined by extending the set of axioms with $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$. At the same time an alternate approach to the set of axioms is shown and both sets are proved to yield the same algebraic structure. A trivial example of loop is used to ensure the existence of the modes being constructed. A multiplicative group is contemplated, which is quite similar to the previously defined additive group (called simply a group here), but is supposed to be of greater interest in the future considerations of algebraic structures. The final section brings a slightly more sophisticated structure i.e: a multiplicative loop/group with zero: $\\langle G, \\cdot, 1, 0\\rangle$. Here the proofs are a more challenging and the above trivial example is replaced by a more common (and comprehensive) structure built on the foundation of real numbers.",

Collinearity is defined as a relation on Cartesian product $\\mizleftcart S, S, S \\mizrightcart$ of set $S$. The basic text is preceeded with a few auxiliary theorems (e.g: ternary relation). Then come the two basic axioms of the collinearity structure: A1.1.1 and A1.1.2 and a few theorems. Another axiom: Aks dim, which states that there exist at least 3 non-collinear points, excludes the trivial structures (i.e. pairs $\\llangle S, \\mizleftcart S, S, S \\mizrightcart\\rrangle$). Following it the notion of a line is included and several additional theorems are appended.",

Each of these two classes of bijections forms a group for a given affine structure, if it satisfies a very weak axiom system (models of these axioms are called congruence spaces); formal isometries form a normal subgroup in the group of automorphism. In particular ordered affine spaces and affine spaces are congruence spaces; therefore formal isometries of these structures can be considered. They are called positive dilatations and dilatations, resp. For convenience the class of negative dilatations, transformations which map every ``vector\" onto parallel ``vector\", but with opposite sense, is singled out. The class of translations is distinguished as well. Basic facts concerning all these types of transformations are established, like rigidity, decomposition principle, introductory group-theoretical properties. At the end collineations of affine spaces and their properties are investigated; for affine planes it is proved that the class of collineations coincides with the class of bijections preserving lines.",

These two types of objects are defined formally as \"Mizar\" modes.

With every such structure we correlate a structure obtained as a reduct of the given one to the parallelity relation only. Some relationships between metric affine spaces and their affine parts are proved; they enable us to use \"affine\" facts and constructions in investigating metric affine geometry.

The second section characterizes the sequence flattening operation, introduced in \\cite{DTCONSTR.ABS}, but so far lacking theorems about its fundamental properties.\\par We first define formal power series in arbitrary number of variables. The auxiliary concept on which the construction of formal power series is based is the notion of a bag. A bag of a set $X$ is a natural function on $X$ which is zero almost everywhere. The elements of $X$ play the role of formal variables and a bag gives their exponents thus forming a power product. Series are defined for an ordered set of variables (we use ordinal numbers). A series in $o$ variables over a structure $S$ is a function assigning an element of the carrier of $S$ (coefficient) to each bag of $o$.\\par We define the operations of addition, complement and multiplication for formal power series and prove their properties which depend on assumed properties of the structure from which the coefficients are taken. (We would like to note that proving associativity of multiplication turned out to be technically complicated.)\\par Polynomial is defined as a formal power series with finite number of non zero coefficients. In conclusion, the ring of polynomials is defined.",

Following it the consecutive structures are contemplated in details, including double loop, left quasi-field, right quasi-field, double sided quasi-field, skew field and field.

Next the mode and proof of its existence is included. If the current set of axioms may be replaced with a different and equivalent one, the appropriate proof is performed following the definition of that mode.

            "summary": "We mean by a normal form a finite set of ordered pairs of subsets of a fixed set that fulfils two conditions: elements of it consist of disjoint sets and element of it are incomparable w.r.t. inclusion. The underlying set corresponds to a set of propositional variables but it is arbitrary. The correspondents to a normal form of a formula, e.g. a disjunctive normal form is as follows. The normal form is the set of disjuncts and a disjunct is an ordered pair consisting of the sets of propositional variables that occur in the disjunct non-negated and negated. The requirement that the element of a normal form consists of disjoint sets means that contradictory disjuncts have been removed and the second condition means that the absorption law has been used to shorten the normal form. We construct a lattice $\\langle {\\Bbb N},\\sqcup,\\sqcap \\rangle$, where $ a \\sqcup b = \\mu (a \\cup b)$ and $a \\sqcap b = \\mu c$, $c$ being set of all pairs $\\langle X_1 \\cup Y_1, X_2 \\cup Y_2 \\rangle$, $\\langle X_1, X_2 \\rangle \\in a$ and $\\langle Y_1,Y_2 \\rangle \\in b$, which consist of disjoiny sets. $\\mu a$ denotes here the set of all minimal, w.r.t. inclusion, elements of $a$.

Positive cone has to contain at least squares of all elements, and be closed under sum and product. Therefore the key notions of this theory are that of square, sum of squares, product of squares, etc. and finally elements generated from squares by means of sums and products.

The second section is concerning with structures with a set and a binary operation on this set: there is introduced the notion corresponding to the notion of some properties of binary operations and there are shown some useful clusters. Next, we are concerning with the structure with a set, a binary operation on the set and with an element of the set. Such a structure is called monoid iff the operation is associative and the element is a unity of the operation. In the fourth section the concept of subsystems of monoid (group) is introduced. Subsystems are submonoids (subgroups) or other parts of monoid (group) with are closed w.r.t. the operation. There are presented facts on inheritness of some properties by subsystems. Finally, there are constructed the examples of groups and monoids: the group $\\rangle{\\Bbb R},+\\langle$ of real numbers with addition, the group ${\\Bbb Z}^+$ of integers as the subsystem of the group $\\rangle{\\Bbb R},+\\langle$, the semigroup $\\rangle{\\Bbb N},+\\langle$ of natural numbers as the subsystem of ${\\Bbb Z}^+$, and the monoid $\\rangle{\\Bbb N},+,0\\langle$ of natural numbers with addition and zero as monoidal extension of the semigroup $\\rangle{\\Bbb N},+\\langle$. The semigroups of real and natural numbers with multiplication are also introduced. The monoid of finite sequences over some set with concatenation as binary operation and with empty sequence as neutral element is defined in sixth section. Last section deals with monoids with the composition of functions as the operation, i.e. with the monoid of partial and total functions and the monoid of permutations.",

Based on \\cite{KURAT:2}, in comparison with the notion of separated subsets (subspaces), some properties of such subsets (subspaces) are discussed. Some necessary facts concerning closed subspaces, open subspaces and the union and the meet of two subspaces are also introduced. To present the main theorems we first formulate basic definitions. Let $X$ be a topological space. Two subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$ of $X$ are called {\\em weakly separated} if $A_1 \\setminus A_2$ and $A_2 \\setminus A_1$ are separated. Two subspaces $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ of $X$ are called {\\em weakly separated} if their carriers are weakly separated. The following theorem contains a useful characterization of weakly separated subsets in the special case when $A_{1} \\cup A_{2}$ is equal to the carrier of $X$. {\\em $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are weakly separated iff there are such subsets of $X$, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ closed (open) and $C$ open (closed, respectively), that $A_{1} \\cup A_{2} = C_{1} \\cup C_{2} \\cup C$, $C_{1} \\subset A_{1}$, $C_{2} \\subset A_{2}$ and $C \\subset A_{1} \\cap A_{2}$}. Next theorem divided into two parts contains similar characterization of weakly separated subspaces in the special case when the union of $X_1$ and $X_2$ is equal to $X$. {\\em If $X_{1}$ meets $X_{2}$, then $X_1$ and $X_2$ are weakly separated iff either $X_{1}$ is a subspace of $X_2$ or $X_2$ is a subspace of $X_{1}$ or there are such open (closed) subspaces $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ of $X$ that $Y_1$ is a subspace of $X_1$ and $Y_2$ is a subspace of $X_2$ and either $X$ is equal to the union of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ or there is a(n) closed (open, respectively) subspace $Y$ of $X$ being a subspace of the meet of $X_1$ and $X_2$ and with the property that $X$ is the union of all $Y_1$, $Y_2$ and $Y$}. {\\em If $X_1$ misses $X_{2}$, then $X_1$ and $X_2$ are weakly separated iff $X_1$ and $X_2$ are open (closed) subspaces of $X$}. Moreover, the following simple characterization of separated subspaces by means of weakly separated ones is obtained. {\\em $X_1$ and $X_2$ are separated iff there are weakly separated subspaces $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ of $X$ such that $X_1$ is a subspace of $Y_1$, $X_2$ is a subspace of $Y_2$ and either $Y_1$ misses $Y_2$ or the meet of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ misses the union of $X_1$ and $X_2$}.",

            "summary": "Category theory had been formalized in Mizar quite early \\cite{CAT_1.ABS}. This had been done closely to the handbook of S. McLane \\cite{MACLANE:1}. In this paper we use a different approach. Category is a triple $$\\langle O, {\\{ \\langle o_1,o_2 \\rangle \\}}_{o_1,o_2 \\in O}, {\\{ \\circ_{o_1,o_2,o_3}\\}}_{o_1,o_2,o_3 \\in O} \\rangle$$ where $\\circ_{o_1,o_2,o_3}: \\langle o_2,o_3 \\rangle \\times \\langle o_1,o_2 \\rangle \\to \\langle o_1, o_3 \\rangle$ that satisfies usual conditions (associativity and the existence of the identities). This approach is closer to the way in which categories are presented in homological algebra (e.g. \\cite{BALCERZYK}, pp.58-59). We do not assume that $\\langle o_1,o_2 \\rangle$'s are mutually disjoint. If $f$ is simultaneously a morphism from $o_1$ to $o_2$ and $o_1'$ to $o_2$ ($o_1 \\neq o_1'$) than different compositions are used ($\\circ_{o_1,o_2,o_3}$ or $\\circ_{o_1',o_2,o_3}$) to compose it with a morphism $g$ from $o_2$ to $o_3$. The operation $g\\cdot f$ has actually six arguments (two visible and four hidden: three objects and the category).\\par We introduce some simple properties of categories. Perhaps more than necessary. It is partially caused by the formalization. The functional categories are characterized by the following properties: \\begin{itemize} \\item quasi-functional that means that morphisms are functions (rather meaningless, if it stands alone) \\item semi-functional that means that the composition of morphism is the composition of functions, provided they are functions. \\item pseudo-functional that means that the composition of morphisms is the composition of functions. \\end{itemize} For categories pseudo-functional is just quasi-functional and semi-functional, but we work in a bit more general setting. Similarly the concept of a discrete category is split into two: \\begin{itemize} \\item quasi-discrete that means that $\\langle o_1,o_2 \\rangle$ is empty for $o_1 \\neq o_2$ and \\item pseudo-discrete that means that $\\langle o, o \\rangle$ is trivial, i.e. consists of the identity only, in a category. \\end{itemize}\\par We plan to follow Semadeni-Wiweger book \\cite{SEMAD}, in the development the category theory in Mizar. However, the beginning is not very close to \\cite{SEMAD}, because of the approach adopted and because we work in Tarski-Grothendieck set theory.",

            "summary": "The class of continuous lattices can be characterized by infinitary equations. Therefore, it is closed under the formation of subalgebras and homomorphic images. Following the terminology of \\cite{Johnstone} we introduce a continuous lattice subframe to be a sublattice closed under the formation of arbitrary infs and directed sups. This notion corresponds with a subalgebra of a continuous lattice in \\cite{CCL}.\\par The class of completely distributive lattices is also introduced in the paper. Such lattices are complete and satisfy the most restrictive type of the general distributivity law. Obviously each completely distributive lattice is a Heyting algebra. It was hard to find the best Mizar implementation of the complete distributivity equational condition (denoted by CD in \\cite{CCL}). The powerful and well developed Many Sorted Theory gives the most convenient way of this formalization. A set double indexed by $K$, introduced in the paper, corresponds with a family $\\{x_{j,k}: j\\in J, k\\in K(j)\\}$. It is defined to be a suitable many sorted function. Two special functors: $\\rm Sups$ and $\\rm Infs$ as counterparts of $\\rm Sup$ and $\\rm Inf$ respectively, introduced in \\cite{YELLOW_2.ABS}, are also defined. Originally the equation in Definition~2.4 of \\cite[p.~58]{CCL} looks as follows: $${\\textstyle\\bigwedge}_{j\\in J} {\\textstyle\\bigvee}_{k\\in K(j)} x_{j,k} = {\\textstyle\\bigvee}_{f\\in M} {\\textstyle\\bigwedge}_{j\\in J} x_{j,f(j)},$$ where $M$ is the set of functions defined on $J$ with values $f(j)\\in K(j)$.

The dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space is, by the most common definition, the number of vectors in a basis. Obviously, each basis contains the same number of vectors. We prove the Steinitz Theorem together with Exchange Lemma in the second section. The Steinitz Theorem says that each linearly-independent subset of a vector space has cardinality less than any subset that generates the space, moreover it can be extended to a basis. Further we review some of the standard facts involving the dimension of a vector space. Additionally, in the last section, we introduce two notions: the family of subspaces of a fixed dimension and the pencil of subspaces. Both of them can be applied in the algebraic representation of several geometries.",

We define the concept of isomorphic categories and prove basic facts related, e.g. that the Cartesian product of categories is associative up to the isomorphism. We introduce the composition of a functor and a transformation, and of transformation and a functor, and afterwards we define again those concepts for natural transformations. Let us observe, that we have to duplicate those concepts because of the permissiveness: if a functor $F$ is not naturally transformable to $G$, then natural transformation from $F$ to $G$ has no fixed meaning, hence we cannot claim that the composition of it with a functor as a transformation results in a natural transformation. We define also the so called horizontal composition of transformations (\\cite{SEMAD}, p.~140, exercise {\\bf 4}.{\\bf 2},{\\bf 5}(C)) and prove {\\em interchange law} (\\cite{MacLane:1}, p.44).

An inspiration to such approach comes from the monograph \\cite{SZMIELEW:1} and so-called Leibniz program. Let us recall that the Leibniz program is a program of algebraization of geometry using purely geometric notions. Leibniz formulated his program in opposition to algebraization method developed by Descartes. The Euclidean geometry in Szmielew's approach \\cite {SZMIELEW:1} is a theory of structures $\\langle S$; $\\parallel, \\oplus, O \\rangle$, where $\\langle S$; $\\parallel, \\oplus, O \\rangle$ is Desarguesian midpoint plane and $O \\subseteq S\\times S\\times S$ is the relation of equi-orthogonal basis. Points $o, p, q$ are in relation $O$ if they form an isosceles triangle with the right angle in vertex $a$. If we fix vertices $a, p$, then there exist exactly two points $q, q'$ such that $O(apq)$, $O(apq')$. Moreover $q \\oplus q' = a$. In accordance with the Leibniz program we replace the relation of equi-orthogonal basis by a binary operation $\\ast : S\\times S \\rightarrow S$, called the reper operation. A standard model for the Euclidean geometry in the above sense is the oriented plane over the field of real numbers with the reper operations $\\ast$ defined by the condition: $a \\ast b = q$ iff the point $q$ is the result of rotating of $p$ about right angle around the center $a$.",

Our proof is based on \\cite{RUDIN:1} (and also \\cite{PATKOWSKA:74}). We prove first auxiliary fact that every open cover of any metrizable space has a locally finite open refinement. We show next the main theorem that every metrizable space is paracompact. The remaining material is devoted to concepts and certain properties needed for the formulation and the proof of that theorem (see also \\cite{PCOMPS_1.ABS}).",

We say that a category $C$ has a finite product if every finite family of objects of $C$ has a product. Our work is based on ideas of \\cite{SZABO}, where the algebraic properties of the proof theory are investigated. The terminal object of a Cartesian category $C$ is denoted by $\\hbox{\\bf 1}_C$. The binary product of $a$ and $b$ is written as $a\\times b$. The projections of the product are written as $pr_1(a,b)$ and as $pr_2(a,b)$. We define the products $f\\times g$ of arrows $f: a\\rightarrow a'$ and $g: b\\rightarrow b'$ as $:a\\times b\\rightarrow a'\\times b'$.\\par Co-Cartesian category is defined dually to the Cartesian category. Dual to a terminal object is an initial object, and to products are coproducts. The initial object of a Cartesian category $C$ is written as $\\hbox{\\bf 0}_C$.

Our purpose is to list a number of properties of such subspaces, supplementary to those given in \\cite{TSEP_1.ABS}. Note that in the Mizar formalism the carrier of any topological space (hence the carrier of any its subspace) is always non--empty, therefore for convenience we list beforehand analogous properties of weakly separated subsets without any additional conditions.\\par To present the main results we first formulate a useful definition. We say that $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ {\\em constitute a decomposition}\\/ of $X$ if $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are disjoint and the union of $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ covers the carrier of $X$ (comp. \\cite{KURAT:2}).

From this theorem we get immediately that under the same hypothesis, {\\em $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are separated iff $X_{1}$ misses $X_{2}$ and $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are weakly separated}. Moreover, we show the following enlargement theorem~: {\\em If $X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ are subspaces of $X$ such that $Y_{i}$ is a subspace of $X_{i}$ and $Y_{1} \\cup Y_{2} = X_{1} \\cup X_{2}$ and if $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are weakly separated, then $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are weakly separated}. We show also the following dual extenuation theorem~: {\\em If $X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ are subspaces of $X$ such that $Y_{i}$ is a subspace of $X_{i}$ and $Y_{1} \\cap Y_{2} = X_{1} \\cap X_{2}$ and if $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are weakly separated, then $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are weakly separated}.

Such spaces and subspaces were investigated in Mizar formalism in \\cite{TSP_1.ABS}. A Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be {\\em maximal}\\/ provided for every Kolmogorov subspace $Y$ of $X$ if $X_{0}$ is subspace of $Y$ then the topological structures of $Y$ and $X_{0}$ are the same.\\par M.H.~Stone proved in \\cite{STONE:3} that every topological space can be made into a Kolmogorov space by identifying points with the same closure (see also \\cite{THRON:1}). The purpose is to generalize the Stone result, using Mizar System. It is shown here that: (1) {\\em in every topological space $X$ there exists a maximal Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$ of $X$}, and (2) {\\em every maximal Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$ of $X$ is a continuous retract of $X$}. Moreover, {\\em if $r : X \\rightarrow X_{0}$ is a continuous retraction of $X$ onto a maximal Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$ of $X$, then $r^{-1}(x) = {\\rm MaxADSet}(x)$ for any point $x$ of $X$ belonging to $X_{0}$, where ${\\rm MaxADSet}(x)$ is a unique maximal anti-discrete subset of $X$ containing $x$} (see \\cite{TEX_4.ABS} for the precise definition of the set ${\\rm MaxADSet}(x)$). The retraction $r$ from the last theorem is defined uniquely, and it is denoted in the text by ``Stone-retraction\". It has the following two remarkable properties: $r$ is open, i.e., sends open sets in $X$ to open sets in $X_{0}$, and $r$ is closed, i.e., sends closed sets in $X$ to closed sets in $X_{0}$.\\par These results may be obtained by the methods described by R.H. Warren in \\cite{WARREN:1}.",

After defining a structure for an outputless finite state machine, we have derived the structures for the transition assigned output machine (Mealy) and state assigned output machine (Moore). The machines are then proved similar, in the sense that for any Mealy (Moore) machine there exists a Moore (Mealy) machine producing essentially the same response for the same input. The rest of work is then done for Mealy machines. Next, we define equivalence of machines, equivalence and $k$-equivalence of states, and characterize a process of constructing for a given Mealy machine, the machine equivalent to it in which no two states are equivalent. The final, minimization theorem states: \\begin{quotation} \\noindent {\\bf Theorem 4.5:} Let {\\bf M}$_1$ and {\\bf M}$_2$ be reduced, connected finite-state machines.

The first is the $cut$ operation that extracts a contiguous chunk of a finite sequence from a position to a position. The second operation is a glueing catenation that given two finite sequences catenates them with removal of the first element of the second sequence. The main topic of the article is to define an operation which for a given chain in a graph returns the sequence of vertices through which the chain passes. We define the exact conditions when such an operation is uniquely definable. This is done with the help of the so called two-valued alternating finite sequences. We also prove theorems about the existence of simple chains which are subchains of a given chain. In order to do this we define the notion of a finite subsequence of a typed finite sequence.",

The paper is divided into three parts. In the first part, we prove some auxiliary theorems concerning properties of balls in metric spaces and define special families of subsets of topological spaces. These concepts are used in the next part of the paper which contains the essential part of the article, namely the formalization of the proof of Weierstrass' theorem. Here, we also prove a theorem concerning the compactness of images of compact sets of $T$ under a continuous function. The final part of this work is developed for the purpose of defining some measures of the distance between compact subsets of topological metric spaces. Some simple theorems about these measures are also proved.",

We start with an auxiliary notion of {\\em bifunction}, i.e. a function mapping the Cartesian square of a set $A$ into the Cartesian square of a set $B$. A {\\em bifunction} $f$ is said to be {\\em covariant} if there is a function $g$ from $A$ into $B$ that $f$ is the Cartesian square of $g$ and $f$ is {\\em contravariant} if there is a function $g$ such that $f(o_1,o_2) = \\langle g(o_2),g(o_1) \\rangle$. The term {\\em transformation}, another auxiliary notion, might be misleading. It is not related to natural transformations. A transformation from a many sorted set $A$ indexed by $I$ into a many sorted set $B$ indexed by $J$ w.r.t. a function $f$ from $I$ into $J$ is a (many sorted) function from $A$ into $B \\cdot f$. Eventually, the morphism map of a functor from $C_1$ into $C_2$ is a transformation from the arrows of the category $C_1$ into the composition of the object map of the functor and the arrows of $C_2$.\\par Several kinds of functor structures have been defined: one-to-one, faithful, onto, full and id-preserving. We were pressed to split property that the composition be preserved into two: comp-preserving (for covariant functors) and comp-reversing (for contravariant functors).

            "summary": "A path from a source vertex $v$ to a target vertex $u$ is said to be a shortest path if its total cost is minimum among all $v$-to-$u$ paths. Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic shortest path algorithm, which is described in many textbooks. To justify its correctness (whose rigorous proof will be given in the next article), it is necessary to clarify its underlying principle. For this purpose, the article justifies the following basic facts, which are the core of Dijkstra's algorithm. \\begin{itemize} \\itemsep-3pt \\item A graph is given, its vertex set is denoted by $V.$ Assume $U$ is the subset of $V,$ and if a path $p$ from $s$ to $t$ is the shortest among the set of paths, each of which passes through only the vertices in $U,$ except the source and sink, and its source and sink is $s$ and in $V,$ respectively, then $p$ is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in the graph, and for any subgraph which contains at least $U,$ it is also the shortest. \\item Let $p(s,x,U)$ denote the shortest path from $s$ to $x$ in a subgraph whose the vertex set is the union of $\\{s,x\\}$ and $U,$ and cost $(p)$ denote the cost of path $p(s,x,U),$ cost$(x,y)$ the cost of the edge from $x$ to $y.$ Give $p(s,x,U),$ $q(s,y,U)$ and $r(s,y,U \\cup \\{x\\})$. If ${\\rm cost}(p) = {\\rm min} \\{{\\rm cost}(w): w(s,t,U) \\wedge t \\in V\\}$, then we have $${\\rm cost}(r) = {\\rm min} ({\\rm cost}(p)+{\\rm cost}(x,y),{\\rm cost}(q)).$$ \\end{itemize} \\noindent This is the well-known triangle comparison of Dijkstra's algorithm.",

By ``special\" we mean, that it is a polygonal curve with edges parallel to axes and actually the lemmas have been proved, mostly, for the triangulations i.e. for finite sequences that define the curve. Moreover some of the results deal only with a special case: \\begin{itemize} \\item[-] finite sequences are clockwise oriented, \\item[-] the first member of the sequence is the member with the lowest ordinate among those with the highest abscissa (N-min $f,$ where $f$ is a finite sequence, in the Mizar jargon). \\end{itemize} In the change of the orientation one has to reverse the sequence (the operation introduced in \\cite{FINSEQ_5.ABS}) and to change the second restriction one has to rotate the sequence (the operation introduced in \\cite{FINSEQ_6.ABS}). The goal of the paper is to prove, mostly simple, facts about the relationship between properties and attributes of the finite sequence and its rotation (similar results about reversing had been proved in \\cite{FINSEQ_5.ABS}). Some of them deal with recounting parameters, others with properties that are invariant under the rotation. We prove also that the finite sequence is either clockwise oriented or it is such after reversing. Everything is proved for the so called standard finite sequences, which means that if a point belongs to it then every point with the same abscissa or with the same ordinate, that belongs to the polygon, belongs also to the finite sequence. It does not seem that this requirement causes serious technical obstacles.",

The important helper notion is the homogeneous function from finite sequences of natural numbers into natural numbers where homogeneous means that all the sequences in the domain are of the same length. The set of all such functions is then used to define the notion of a set closed under composition of functions and under primitive recursion. We call a set primitively recursively closed iff it contains the initial functions (nullary constant function returning 0, unary successor and projection functions for all arities) and is closed under composition and primitive recursion. The set of primitive recursive functions is then defined as the smallest set of functions which is primitive recursively closed. We show that this set can be obtained by primitive recursive approximation. We finish with showing that some simple and well known functions are primitive recursive.",

PCSs were invented, however, to construct Scott domains, to solve domain equations, and to construct models of various versions of lambda calculus.\\par For more on PCSs, see \\cite{Krivine}. The present Mizar paper defines the operations on PCSs used in Chapter 8 of \\cite{berline97kappadenotational}.",

The formula was first stated in print by Euler in 1758 \\cite{euler1758a}. The proof given here is based on Poincare's linear algebraic proof, stated in \\cite{poincare1893} (with a corrected proof in \\cite{poincare1899}), as adapted by Imre Lakatos in the latter's \\textsl{Proofs and Refutations} \\cite{proofs-and-refutations}.\\par As is well known, Euler's formula is not true for all polyhedra. The condition on polyhedra considered here is simple connectedness, which says that the cycles (chains whose boundary is zero) are exactly the bounding chains (chains that are the boundary of a chain of one higher dimension).\\par The present proof actually goes beyond the three-dimensional version of the polyhedal formula given by Lakatos; it is dimension-free, in the sense that it gives a formula in which the dimension of the polyhedron is a parameter. The classical Euler relation $V - E + F = 2$ is corresponds to the case where the dimension of the polyhedron is $3$. \\par The main theorem, expressed in the language of the present article, is $$\\mathtt{Sum alternating-characteristic-sequence(p) = 0},$$ where $p$ is a polyhedron. The alternating characteristic sequence of a polyhedron is the sequence $$ -N(-1), +N(0), -N(1), \\dots, (-1)^(\\dim(p))*N(\\dim(p)),$$ where $N(k)$ is the number of polytopes of $p$ of dimension $k$. The special case of $\\dim(p) = 3$ yields Euler's classical relation. ($N(-1)$ and $N(3)$ will turn out to be equal, by definition, to $1$.) \\par Two other special cases are proved in the present article: the first says that a simply connected one-dimensional \"polyhedron\" consists of just two vertices (and thus consists of just a single edge); the second special case asserts that a two-dimensional simply-connected polyhedron (a polygon) has as many vertices as edges. \\par A treatment of the more general version of Euler's relation can be found in \\cite{grunbaum2003} and \\cite{brondsted1983}. The former contains a proof of Steinitz's theorem, which shows that the abstract polyhedra treated in Poincar\\'e's proof, which might not appear to be about polyhedra in the usual sense of the word, are in fact embeddable in $\\mathbf{R}^3$ under certain conditions. It would be valuable to formalize a proof of Steinitz's theorem and relate it to the development contained here.",

The expression may include variables, constants, and a limited number of arithmetic operations. States are functions from a given set of locations into integers. A variable is a function from the states into the locations and an expression is a function from the states into integers. Additional conditions (computability) limit the set of variables and expressions and, simultaneously, allow to write algorithms in a natural way (and to prove their correctness).\\par As examples the proofs of full correctness of two Euclid algorithms (with modulo operation and subtraction) and algorithm of exponentiation by squaring are given.

The theory presented is an abstraction from the existing implementation of the Mizar system and is devoted to the formalization of Mizar expressions. The base idea behind the formalization is dependence from variables which is determined by variable-dependence (variables may depend from another variables). The dependence stands a Galois connection between opposite poset of dependence-closed set of variables and the sup-semilattice of widening of Mizar types (smooth type widening).\\par In the paper the concepts strictly connected with Mizar expressions are formalized. Among them are quasi-loci, quasi-terms, quasi-adjectives, and quasi-types. The structural induction and operation of substitution are, also, introduced. The prefix {\\it quasi} is used to indicate that some rules of construction of Mizar expressions may not be fulfilled. For example, variables, quasi-loci, and quasi-terms have no assigned types and, in the result, there is no possibility to do type-checking of arguments. The other gaps concern inconsistent and out-of-context clusters of adjectives in types. Those rules are required in the Mizar {\\it identification} process. However, the expression appearing in later processes of Mizar checker may not satisfy the rules. So, introduced apparatus is enough and adequate to describe data structuers and algorithms from Mizar checker (like {\\it equational classes}).",

We define the circuit structure of four-types FTAs, TYPE-0 to TYPE-3, using the series constructions of the Generalized Full Adder Circuits (GFAs) that generalized adder to have for each positive and negative weights to inputs and outputs \\cite{GFACIRC1}.

If both $p$ and $2p+1$ are prime numbers, we call $p$ as Sophie Germain prime, and $2p+1$ as safe prime. It is known that the product of two safe primes is a composite number that is difficult for some factoring algorithms to factorize into prime factors. In addition, safe primes are also important in cryptography system because of their use in discrete logarithm based techniques like Diffie-Hellman key exchange. If $p$ is a safe prime, the multiplicative group of numbers modulo $p$ has a subgroup of large prime order. However, no definitions have not been established yet with the safe prime and Sophie Germain prime. So it is important to give definitions of the Sophie Germain prime and safe prime. \\par In this article, we prove finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is a cyclic group, and, further, define the safe prime and Sophie Germain prime, and prove several facts about them. In addition, we define Mersenne number (${M}_{n}$), and some facts about Mersenne numbers and prime numbers are proven. ",

This is a first step towards formalizing Conway's theory of numbers into Mizar, which is an approach to proving the existence of a FIELD (i.e., a proper class that satisfies the axioms of a real-closed field) that includes the reals and ordinals, thus providing a uniform, independent and simple approach to these two constructions that does not go via the rational numbers and hence does for example not need the notion of a quotient field.\\par In this first article on Conway's games, we provide a definition of games, their birthdays (or ranks), their trees (a notion which is not in Conway's book, but is useful as a tool), their negates and their signs, together with some elementary properties of these notions. If one is interested only in Conway's numbers, it would have been easier to define them directly, but going via the notion of a game is a more general approach in the sense that a number is a special instance of a game and that there is a rich theory of games that are not numbers.\\par The main obstacle in formulating these topics in Mizar is that all definitions are highly recursive, which is not entirely simple to translate into the Mizar language. For example, according to Conway's definition, a game is an object consisting of left and right options which are themselves games, and this is by definition the only way to construct a game. This cannot directly be translated into Mizar, but a theorem is included in the article which proves that our definition is equivalent to Conway's.",

These articles introduce a framework for treating arbitrary languages with equality. This framework is kept as generic and modular as possible: both the language and the derivation rule are introduced as a type, rather than a fixed functor; definitions and results regarding syntax, semantics, interpretations and sequent derivation rules, respectively, are confined to separate articles, to mark out the hierarchy of dependences among different definitions and constructions. As an application limited to countable languages, satisfiability theorem and a full version of Goedel completeness theorem are delivered, with respect to a fixed, remarkably thrifty, set of correct rules. Besides the self-referential significance for the Mizar project itself of those theorems being formalized with respect to a generic, equality-furnished, countable language, this is the first step to work out other milestones of model theory, such as Lowenheim-Skolem and compactness theorems. Being the receptacle of all results of broader scope stemmed during the various formalizations, this first article stays at a very generic level, with results and registrations about objects already in MML. Without introducing the Language structure yet, three fundamental definitions of wide applicability are also given: the `unambiguous' attribute (cfr. \\cite{lothaire2002algebraic} definition on page 5), the functor `-multiCat', which is the iteration of `^' over a FinSequence of FinSequence, and the functor SubstWith, which realizes the substitution of a single symbol inside a generic FinSequence.",

A Language is defined basically as a tuple made of an integer-valued function (adicity), a symbol of equality and a symbol for the NOR logical connective. The only requests for this tuple to be a Language is that the value of the adicity in = is -2 and that its preimage (ie the variables set) in 0 is infinite. Existential quantification will be rendered (see \\CITE{FOMODEL2.ABS}) by mere prefixing a formula with a letter. Then the hierarchy among symbols according to their adicity is introduced, taking advantage of attributes and clusters. The strings of symbols of a language are depth-recursively classified as terms using the standard approach (see for example \\CITE{pohlers1992introduction}, definition 1.1.2); technically, this is done here by deploying the `-multiCat' functor and the `unambiguous' attribute previously introduced in \\CITE{FOMODEL0.ABS}, and the set of atomic formulas is introduced. The set of all terms is shown to be unambiguous with respect to concatenation; we say that it is a prefix set. This fact is exploited to uniquely define the subterms both of a term and of an atomic formula without resorting to a parse tree. ",

            "summary": "Fourth of a series of articles laying down the bases for classical first order model theory. This paper supplies a toolkit of constructions to work with languages and interpretations, and results relating them. The free interpretation of a language, having as a universe the set of terms of the language itself, is defined. The quotient of an interpreteation with respect to an equivalence relation is built, and shown to remain an interpretation when the relation respects it. Both the concepts of quotient and of respecting relation are defined in broadest terms, with respect to objects as general as possible. Along with the trivial symbol substitution generally defined in \\CITE{FOMODEL0.ABS}, the more complex substitution of a letter with a term is defined, basing right on the free interpretation just introduced, which is a novel approach, to the author's knowledge. A first important result shown is that the quotient operation commute in some sense with term evaluation and reassignment functors, both introduced in \\CITE{FOMODEL2.ABS} (Th3, Th15). A second result proved is substitution lemma (Th10, corresponding to III.8.3 of \\CITE{ebbinghaus1994mathematical}). This will be vital for proving satisfiability theorem and correctness of a certain sequent derivation rule in \\CITE{FOMODEL4.ABS}. A third result supplied is that if two given languages coincide on the letters of a given FinSequence, their evaluation of it will also coincide. This too will be instrumental in \\CITE{FOMODEL4.ABS} for proving correctness of another rule. Also, the Depth functor is shown to be invariant with respect to term substitution in a formula. ",

This paper presents multiple themes: first it introduces sequents, rules and sets of rules for a FO language L as L-dependent types. Then defines derivability and provability according to a set of rules, and gives several technical lemmas binding all those concepts. Following that, it introduces a fixed set D of derivation rules, and proceeds to convert them to Mizar functorial cluster registrations to give the user a slick interface to apply them. The remaining goals summon all the definitions and results introduced in this series of articles: - first, D is shown to be correct and having the requisites to deliver a sensible definition of Henkin model (see \\CITE{ebbinghaus1994mathematical}) - second, as a particular application of all the machinery built thus far, the satisfiability and Goedel completeness theorems are shown when restricting to countable languages. The techniques used to attain this are inspired from \\CITE{ebbinghaus1994mathematical}, then heavily modified with the twofold goal of embedding them into the more flexible framework of a variable ruleset here introduced, and of proving completeness of a set of rules more sparing than the one there used; in particular the simpler ruleset allowed to avoid the definition and tractation of free occurence of a literal, a fact which, along with shortening proofs, is remarkable in its own right.

However, if we would like to consider a topological manifold with a boundary, we have to extend this definition. Therefore we introduce here the concept of a locally Euclidean space that covers both cases (with and without a boundary), i.e. where each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to a closed ball of ${\\cal E}^n$ for some $n$. \\par Our purpose is to prove, using the Mizar formalism, a number of properties of such locally Euclidean spaces and use them to demonstrate basic properties of a manifold. Let $T$ be a locally Euclidean space. We prove that every interior point of $T$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball and that every boundary point of $T$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a closed ball, where additionally this point is transformed into a point of the boundary of this ball. When $T$ is $n$-dimensional, i.e. each point of $T$ has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to a closed ball of ${\\cal E}^n$, we show that the interior of $T$ is a locally Euclidean space without boundary of dimension $n$ and the boundary of $T$ is a locally Euclidean space without boundary of dimension $n-1$. Additionally, we show that every connected component of a compact locally Euclidean space is a locally Euclidean space of some dimension. We prove also that the Cartesian product of locally Euclidean spaces also forms a locally Euclidean space. We determine the interior and boundary of this product and show that its dimension is the sum of the dimensions of its factors. At the end, we present several consequences of these results for topological manifolds. This article is based on \\cite{ENGEL:BM51}.",

This means that every pair of distinct points in the Sorgenfrey line can be separated by disjoint open neighbourhoods. Next, we proved that all subspaces of \\verb!R^1! (that is the real line with the usual topology) are Lindelof, i.e. every open cover has a countable sub-cover. We utilize this result in the proof. This proof is based on the proof found in \\cite{Engelking:1968}. Next, we construct the Sorgenfrey plane, as the product topology of the Sorgenfrey line and itself. We prove that the Sorgenfrey plane is NOT Lindelof, and therefore the product spaces need not be Lindelof. Further, we state that the Sorgenfrey line is regular, following from \\cite{TOPGEN_5.ABS}:59, since Tychonoff implies regular. Then we state that the Sorgenfrey line is normal since it is both regular and Lindelof. Normal spaces ensure that every pair of disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open neighbourhoods. Finally, we prove that the Sorgenfrey Plane is NOT Normal, and hence the product of two normal spaces need not be normal. The proof that the Sorgenfrey Plane is normal and many of the lemmas leading up to this result, are modelled after the proof in \\cite{TOPGEN_5.ABS}, that the Niemytzki-plane is not normal.

Then our structures are based on three relations on the (arbitrary, not necessarily finite) set of alternatives. The completeness property can however also be modelled, although we rather follow \\cite{Aumann} which is more general \\cite{Schumm}. Additionally we assume all three relations are disjoint and their set-theoretic union gives a whole universe of alternatives. \\par We constructed some positive and negative examples of preference structures; main aim of the article however is to give the characterization of consumer preference structures in terms of a binary relation, called characteristic relation \\cite{Panek}, and to show the way the corresponding structure can be obtained only using this relation.

            "summary": "We continue the work on mathematical modeling of hardware and software started in \\cite{AMI_1.ABS}. The main objective of this paper is the definition of a program. We start with the concept of partial product, i.e. the set of all partial functions $f$ from $I$ to $\\bigcup_{i\\in I} A_i$, fulfilling the condition $f.i \\in A_i$ for $i \\in dom f$. The computation and the result of a computation are defined in usual way. A finite partial state is called autonomic if the result of a computation starting with it does not depend on the remaining memory and an AMI is called programmable if it has a non empty autonomic partial finite state. We prove the consistency of the following set of properties of an AMI: data-oriented, halting, steady-programmed, realistic and programmable. For this purpose we define a trivial AMI. It has only the instruction counter and one instruction location. The only instruction of it is the halt instruction. A preprogram is a finite partial state that halts. We conclude with the definition of a program of a partial function $F$ mapping the set of the finite partial states into itself. It is a finite partial state $s$ such that for every finite partial state $s' \\in dom F$ the result of any computation starting with $s+s'$ includes $F.s'$.",

It is hard to formalize all halting conditions, but some cases can be formalized. We choose loop invariants as halting conditions to prove halting problem of for-up/down statements. When some variables (except the loop control variable) keep undestroyed on a set for the loop invariant, and the loop body is halting for this condition, the corresponding for-up/down is halting and computable under this condition.

We decided to merge topological spaces with tolerance approximation spaces. As a testbed for our developed approach we restated results of Isomichi \\cite{ISOMICHI} (formalized in Mizar in \\cite{ISOMICHI}) and about fourteen sets of Kuratowski \\cite{KURAT:4} (encoded with the help of Mizar adjectives and clusters' registrations in \\cite{KURATO_1.ABS}) in terms of rough approximations.

Also Jensen's inequality is already present in the Mizar Mathematical Library. We were impressed by the beauty and elegance of the simple proof by induction and so we decided to follow this specific way. \\par The proof follows similar lines as that written in Isabelle \\cite{Cauchy-AFP}; the comparison of both could be really interesting as it seems that in both systems the number of lines needed to prove this are really close.",

We partially prove the theorem of \\cite{Schwabhauser:1983} that Tarski's (extremely weak!) plane geometry axioms imply Hilbert's axioms. He got about as far as Narboux, with Gupta's amazing proof which implies Hilbert's axiom I1 that two points determine a line. \\par The primary Mizar coding was heavily influenced by \\cite{INCSP_1.ABS} on axioms of incidence geometry. The original development was much improved using Mizar adjectives instead of predicates only, and to use this machinery in full extent, we have to construct some models of Tarski geometry. These are listed in the second section, together with appropriate registrations of clusters. Also models of Tarski's geometry related to real planes were constructed.",

Next, we defined \\verb!RNS_Real!, real number spaces as real normed spaces and proved related theorems. We can regard linear functionals as linear operators by this definition. Accordingly we proved Uniform Boundedness Theorem for linear functionals using the theorem 5 from \\cite{LOPBAN_5.ABS}.

Note that in order to have more usable approach in \\cite{FUZZY_1.ABS}, we revised that article also. As we can actually understand fuzzy sets just as their membership functions (via the equality of membership function and their set-theoretic counterpart), all the calculations are much simpler. To test our simple approach, we give the notions of (normal) triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy sets as the examples of concrete objects. Also $\\alpha$-cuts, the core of a fuzzy set, and normalized fuzzy sets were defined. Main technical obstacle was to prove continuity of the glued maps, and in fact we did this not through its topological counterpart, but extensively reusing properties of the real line (with loss of generality of the approach, though), because we aim at formalizing fuzzy numbers in our future submissions, as well as merging with rough set approach as introduced in \\cite{ROUGHS_1.ABS}. Our base for formalization was \\cite{DuboisPrade:1980}.",

Later, in investigations by Monteiro and Brignole and \\cite{Brignole} the name ``Nelson algebras\" was adopted -- which is now commonly used to show the correspondence with Nelson's paper \\cite{Nelson} on constructive logic with strong negation. \\par In this article we give the definition and basic properties of these algebras according to \\cite{RasiowaNonClassical} and \\cite{Rasiowa:2001}. We start with preliminary section on quasi-Boolean algebras (i.e. de Morgan bounded lattices). Later we give the axioms in the form of Mizar adjectives with names corresponding with those in \\cite{Rasiowa:2001}. As our main result we give two axiomatizations (non-equational and equational) and the full formal proof of their equivalence. \\par The second set of equations is rather long but it shows the logical flavour of Nelson lattices. This formalization aims at the construction of algebraic model of rough sets in our future submissions.",

            "summary": "Proving properties of distributed algorithms is still a highly challenging problem and various approaches that have been proposed to tackle it \\cite{abr99} can be roughly divided into state-based and event-based proofs. Informally speaking, state-based approaches define the behavior of a distributed algorithm as a set of sequences of memory states during its executions, while event-based approaches treat the behaviors by means of events which are produced by the executions of an algorithm. Of course, combined approaches are also possible. \\par Analysis of the literature \\cite{abr99,chandy88,Patt86,lamport86,raynal91,Ridge2006,Ridge2007} shows that state-based approaches are more widely used than event-based approaches for proving properties of algorithms, and the difficulties in the event-based approach are often emphasized. We believe, however, that there is a certain naturalness and intuitive content in event-based proofs of correctness of distributed algorithms that makes this approach worthwhile. Besides, state-based proofs of correctness of distributed algorithms are usually applicable only to discrete-time models of distributed systems and cannot be easily adapted to the continuous time case which is important in the domain of cyber-physical systems. On the other hand, event-based proofs can be readily applied to continuous-time / hybrid models of distributed systems. \\par In the paper \\cite{AbrIvNikitch2011} we presented a compositional approach to reasoning about behavior of distributed systems in terms of events. Compositionality here means (informally) that semantics and properties of a program is determined by semantics of processes and process communication mechanisms. We demonstrated the proposed approach on a proof of the mutual exclusion property of Peterson's algorithm \\cite{Peterson81}. We have also demonstrated an application of this approach for proving the mutual exclusion property in the setting of continuous-time models of cyber-physical systems in \\cite{IvanovNikitchAbr2014}. \\par In this paper we give a formal proof of the mutual exclusion property of Peterson's algorithm in Mizar on the basis of the event-based approach proposed in \\cite{AbrIvNikitch2011}. Firstly, we define an event-based model of a shared-memory distributed system as a multi-sorted algebraic structure in which sorts are events, processes, locations (i.e. addresses in the shared memory), traces (of the system). The operations of this structure include a binary precedence relation <= on the set of events which turns it into a linear preorder (events are considered simultaneous, if e1<=e2 and e2<=e1), special predicates which check if an event occurs in a given process or trace, predicates which check if an event causes the system to read from or write to a given memory location, and a special partial function \"val_of\" on events which gives the value associated with a memory read or write event (i.e. a value which is written or is read in this event) \\cite{AbrIvNikitch2011}. Then we define several natural consistency requirements (axioms) for this structure which must hold in every distributed system, e.g. each event occurs in some process, etc. (details are given in \\cite{AbrIvNikitch2011}). \\par After this we formulate and prove the main theorem about the mutual exclusion property of the Peterson's algorithm in an arbitrary consistent algebraic structure of events. Informally, the main theorem states that if a system consists of two processes, and in some trace there occur two events e1 and e2 in different processes and each of these events is preceded by a series of three special events (in the same process) guaranteed by execution of the Peterson's algorithm (setting the flag of the current process, writing the identifier of the opposite process to the \"turn\" shared variable, and reading zero from the flag of the opposite process or reading the identifier of the current process from the \"turn\" variable), and moreover, if neither process writes to the flag of the opposite process or writes its own identifier to the \"turn\" variable, then either the events e1 and e2 coincide, or they are not simultaneous (mutual exclusion property).",

At the end we formalize the notion of the Stone lattice constructed as a sublattice of $B^2$, where $B$ is arbitrary Boolean algebra (and we describe skeleton and the set of dense elements in such lattices). In a natural way, we deal with Cartesian product of pseudo-complemented lattices. \\par Our formalization was inspired by \\cite{NewGratzer}, and is an important step in formalizing Jouni J{\\\"a}rvinen \\emph{Lattice theory for rough sets} \\cite{Jarvinen:2007}, so it follows rather the latter paper.",

Here we continue to do this. Next we define the stochastic process. For further definitions based on stochastic process we implement the definition of filtration. \\par To get a better understanding we give a real world example and connect the statements to the theorems. Other similar examples are given in \\cite{kremer:2006}, p. 143--159 and \\cite{sandmann:2001}, p. 110--124. \\par First we introduce sets which give informations depending on today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. \\par Today: Omega_now = {{},{1,2,3,4}} see FINANCE3:def 6, Special_SigmaField1 Tomorrow: Omega_fut1 = {{},{1,2},{3,4},{1,2,3,4}} see FINANCE3:def 7, Special_SigmaField2 The day after tomorrow: Omega_fut2 = power set of({1,2,3,4}) see FINANCE3:def 8, Special_SigmaField3 \\par We give an overview for some events in the sigma-algebras Omega_now,Omega_fut1,Omega_fut2: \\par Events of Omega_fut2 Events of Omega_fut1 Events of Omega_now {} = {} = {} {1} c= {1,2} c= {1,2,3,4} {2} c= {1,2} c= {1,2,3,4} {3} c= {3,4} c= {1,2,3,4} {4} c= {3,4} c= {1,2,3,4} {1,2,3,4} = {1,2,3,4} = {1,2,3,4} see FINANCE3:20 and FINANCE3:21 The given events are necessary for creating our next functions. \\par The implementations looks like: Omega_now c= Omega_fut1 c= Omega_fut2 see theorem FINANCE3:22.

Here we drop the classical equivalence- and tolerance-based models of rough sets trying to formalize some parts of \\cite{Zhu:2007}. \\par The main aim of this Mizar article is to provide a formal counterpart for the rest of the paper of William Zhu. In order to do this, we recall also Theorem 3 from Y.Y. Yao's paper. The first part of our formalization (covering first seven pages) is contained in \\cite{ROUGHS_2.ABS}. Now we start from page 5003, sec. 3.4. We formalized almost all numbered items (definitions, propositions, theorems, and corollaries), with the exception of Proposition 7, where we stated our theorem only in terms of singletons. We provided more thorough discussion of the property \"\\verb!positive_alliance!\" and its connection with seriality and reflexivity (and also transitivity). Examples were not covered as a rule as we aim to provide a more general mechanism of finding appropriate models for approximation spaces in Mizar providing more automatization than it is now. \\par Of course, we can see some more general applications of some registrations of clusters, essentially not dealing with the notion of an approximation: the notions of an alliance binary relation was not defined in the Mizar Mathematical Library before, and we should think about other properties which are also absent but needed in the context of rough approximations.",

The second is that on geometrical progressions. Geometrical progressions are involved in nearly all financial questions involving compound interest -- mortgages, annuities, etc.\" \\cite{sawyer1970}.

While the above notion seems not to be changed over the last 50 years, it reflect only a special case of a broader class of problems involving two variables. It seems strange, that while binomial formula is discussed and studied widely, little research is done on its counterpart with all coefficients equal to one, which we will call here the subnomial. The study focuses on its basic properties and applies it to some simple problems usually proven by induction \\cite{gancarzewicz2000}.",

We give examples of stopping times using constant-functions or functions defined with the operator max or min (defined in \\cite{klenke:2006},p.37-38). Last we give an example with some given filtration. Stopping times are very important for stochastic finance. A stopping time is the moment, where a certain event occurs \\cite{kremer:2006},p.372), and can be used together with stochastic processes (\\cite{follmerschied:2004},p.283). Look at the following example: We install a function ST:{1,2,3,4}->{0,1,2} \\/ {+infty} We define: a. ST(1)=1, ST(2)=1, ST(3)=2, ST(4)=2 b. The set {0,1,2} consists of time points: 0=now,1=tomorow,2=the day after tomorrow We can prove: b. {w where w is Element of Omega: ST.w=0}={} & {w where w is Element of Omega: ST.w=1}={1,2} & {w where w is Element of Omega: ST.w=2}={3,4} and c. ST is a stopping time. We use a function Filt as Filtration of {01,2},Sigma where Filt(0)=Omega_now, Filt(1)=Omega_fut1 and Filt(2)=Omega_fut2. From a.,b. and c. we know that: d. {w where w is Element of Omega: ST.w=0} in Omega_now and {w where w is Element of Omega: ST.w=1} in Omega_fut1 and {w where w is Element of Omega: ST.w=2} in Omega_fut2 The sets in d. are events, which occur at the time points 0(=now),1(=tomorrow) or 2(=the day after tomorrow), see also \\cite{kremer:2006},p.371. Suppose ST(1)=+infty, then this means, that for ST(1) never stops. As an interpretation for our installed functions consider the given adapted stochastic process in the article FINANCE3. ST(1)=1 means, that the given element 1 in {1,2,3,4} is stopped in 1 (=tomorrow). That tells us, that we have to look at the value f_2(1) which is equal to 80. Same argumentation for the element 2 in {1,2,3,4}. ST(3)=2 means, that the given element 3 in {1,2,3,4} is stopped in 2 (=the day after tomorrow). That tells us, that we have to look at the value f_3(3) which is equal to 100. ST(4)=2 means, that the given element 4 in {1,2,3,4} is stopped in 2 (=the day after tomorrow). That tells us, that we have to look at the value f_3(4) which is equal to 120. In real world, these functions can be used for questions like: When does the share price exceed a certain limit, see \\cite{kremer:2006},p.372). ",

            "summary": "In preparation for the formulization of lotteries as given in \\cite{MSZ}, this article closes some gaps in the MML regarding relational structures. The quotient order is introduced by the equivalence relation identifying two elements $x, y$ of a preorder as equivalent if $x <= y$ and $y <= x$ holds. This concept was first introduced into the MML in \\cite{DICKSON.ABS} and that work is incorporated here. Furthermore given a set $A$, partitio finite-support function $f:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb {R}$, a function $\\sum_f : D \\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, \\sum_f (X) = \\sum_{x\\in X} f(x)$ can be defined as some kind of natural \"restriction\" from $f$ to $D$. The first main result of this article can then be formulated as: \\[\\sum_{x\\in A} f(x) = \\sum_{X\\in D}\\sum_f (X) \\left(= \\sum_{X\\in D}\\sum_{x\\in X} f(x)\\right)\\] After that (weakly-)ascending/descending finite sequences (based on \\cite{FINSEQ_1.ABS}) are introduced, in analogous notation to their infinite counterparts introduced in \\cite{WELLFND1.ABS} and \\cite{DICKSON.ABS}. The second main result is any finite subset of any transitive connected relational structure can be sorted as a ascending or descending finite sequence, thus generalizing the results from \\cite{RFINSEQ2.ABS}, where finite sequence of real numbers where sorted. The third main result of the article is that any weakly-ascending/weakly-descending finite sequence on elements of a preorder induces a weakly-ascending/weakly-descending finite sequence on the projection of these elements into the quotient order.\\par Additionally, some auxiliary theorems are provided, e.g. two schemes to find a smallest or largest element in a finite subset of a connected transitive relational structure with a given property and a lemma I found rather useful: Given two finite one-to-one sequences $s, t$ on a set $X$, such that $\\rng t \\subseteq \\rng s$, and a function $f:X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is zero for every $x\\in\\rng s\\setminus\\rng t$, we have $\\sum f\\circ s = \\sum f\\circ t$.",

We also proved some related properties. In Sec.2, we proved some lemmas for the proof of F. Riesz theorem. In Sec.3, we proved F. Riesz theorem, about the dual space of the space of continuous functions on closed interval subset of real numbers, finally. We applied Hahn-Banach theorem \\cite{DUALSP01.ABS:36} to the proof of the last theorem.

            "summary": "In this article, we prove, using the Mizar formalism, a number of properties that correspond to the Pell's Equation to prove finally two basic lemmas that are essential in the proof of Matiyasevich's negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem. \\par For this purpose, first, we focus on a special case of the Pell's Equation, which has the form \\begin{equation}x^2-(a^2-1)y^2=1, \\end{equation} where $a>1$ and integer numerical solutions are sought for $x$ and $y$. We develop the Pell's Equation theory formalized for the general case in \\cite{Pelle_eq.abs}. Note that $x_0(a)=1$, $y_0(a)=0$ is an obvious solution. Additionally, if we know a solution of the Pell's equation, we can determine all solutions as well as we can order them. In our case the $n+1$-solution $x_{n+1}(a)$, $y_{n+1}(a)$ can be simply determined in terms of the $n$-solution as follows: \\begin{align} x_{n+1}(a) =& a \\cdot x_n(a) + (a^2-1)\\cdot y_n(a)\\notag\\\\ y_{n+1}(a) =& x_n(a) + a \\cdot y_n(a)\\notag \\end{align} We show a number of dependency between the elements of these sequences to provide that the equality $y_z(a)=y$ is diophantin. For this purpose we justify that for a given $a$, $z$, $y$ holds $y_z(a)=y$ if and only if the following system has a solution for natural numbers $x$, $x_1$, $y_1$, $A$, $x_2$, $y_2$: \\begin{align} &a>1 \\;\\wedge\\; y_1\\geq y \\;\\wedge\\; A > y \\;\\wedge\\; y \\geq z\\;\\wedge\\notag\\\\ &x^2 - (a^2-1)y^2 =1\\;\\wedge\\; x_1^2 - (a^2-1)y_1^2 =1\\;\\wedge\\; x_2^2 - (A^2-1)y_2^2 =1 \\;\\wedge\\notag\\\\ &y_2 \\equiv y \\mbox{ mod } x_1 \\;\\wedge\\;A \\equiv a \\mbox{ mod } x_1\\;\\wedge\\notag\\\\ &y_2 \\equiv z \\mbox{ mod } 2y\\;\\wedge\\;A \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ mod } 2y\\;\\wedge\\;y_1\\equiv 0 \\mbox{ mod } y^2\\notag \\end{align} Based on this result we prove that the equality $y = x^z$ is diophantin. For this purpose we justify that for a given $x$, $y$, $z$ that $y = x^z$ if and only if \\begin{align} & (y = 1 \\wedge z = 0) \\;\\vee\\notag\\\\ & (x = 0 \\wedge y = 0 \\wedge z > 0) \\;\\vee\\;(x = 1 \\wedge y = 1 \\wedge z > 0) \\;\\vee\\notag\\\\ &(x > 1 \\wedge z > 0 \\wedge \\exists_{ y_1,y_2,y_3,K \\in\\mathbb{N}}\\notag\\\\ & \\strut\\mkern50mu y_1 = y_{z+1}(x) \\wedge K > 2zy_1 \\wedge y_2 = y_{z+1}(K) \\wedge y_3 = y_{z+1}(Kx) \\wedge\\notag\\\\ & \\strut\\mkern50mu (0 \\leq y-\\frac{y_3}{y_2} <\\frac{1}{2} \\vee 0 \\leq \\frac{y_3}{y_2} -y < \\frac{1}{2})).\\notag \\end{align} \\par The formalization follows Z.

Next we construct and prove the simple random-variables (\\cite{heinz:2002}, p.~14).\\par In the second part, we introduce the definition of arbitrage opportunity. Next we show, that this definition can be characterized in a different way (Lemma 1.3. in \\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.~5). In our formalization for Lemma 1.3 we make the assumption that phi is a Real_Sequence (there are only finitley many valued of interest, the values of phi in $R^d$). For the definition of almost sure with Probability 1 see \\cite{heinz:2002}, p.~6. Last we introduce the risk-neutral Probability (Definition 1.4. in \\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.~6). We give an example in real world: Suppose you have some assets like bonds (riskless assets). Then we can fix our price for these bonds with $x$ for today and $x*(1+r)$ for tomorrow, $r$ is the interest rate. So we simply assume, that in every possible market evolution of tomorrow we have a determinated value. Then every probability measure of \\verb!Omega_fut1! is a risk-neutral measure (see FINANCE7:13). This example shows the existence of some risk-neutral measure. If you find more than one of them, you can determine - with an additional conidition to the probability measures - whether a market model is arbitrage free or not (see Theorem 1.6. in \\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.~6.)\\par A short graph for FINANCE7:13: \\par Suppose we have a portfolio with many (in this example infinitely many) assets.

            "summary": "We show that the set of all partial predicates over a set $D$ together with the disjunction, conjunction, and negation operations (denoted in the paper as {\\tt PP\\_or}, {\\tt PP\\_and}, and {\\tt PP\\_not}), defined in accordance with the truth tables of S.C. Kleene's strong logic of indeterminacy \\cite{Kleene1952}, forms a~Kleene algebra. A~Kleene algebra is a~De Morgan algebra \\cite{Brignole1964} (also called quasi-Boolean algebra) which satisfies the condition $x \\wedge \\neg x \\le y \\vee \\neg y$ (sometimes called the normality axiom). We use the formalization of De Morgan algebras from \\cite{ROBBINS1.ABS}. \\par The term ``Kleene algebra'' was introduced by A.~Monteiro and D.~Brignole in \\cite{Brignole1964}. A~similar notion of a~``normal i-lattice'' had been previously studied by J.A. Kalman \\cite{Kalman1958}. More details about the origin of this notion and i relation to other notions can be found in \\cite{Monteiro1996,Cignoli1975,Balbes1975,Blyth1994}. It should be noted that there is a~different widely known class of algebras, also called Kleene algebras \\cite{Kozen1990,Conway1971}, which generalize the algebra of regular expressions, however, the term ``Kleene algebra'' used in this paper does not refer to them. \\par Algebras of partial predicates naturally arise in computability theory in the study on partial recursive predicates. They were studied in connection with non-classical logics \\cite{Kleene1952,Cleave1991,Korner1966,Rasiowa1974,NikitchShkilniak2013, NikShk2017:QE-calculus}. A~partial predicate also corresponds to the notion of a~partial set \\cite{Negri1998} on a~given domain, which represents a~(partial) property which for any given element of this domain may hold, not hold, or neither hold nor not h field of all partial sets on a~given domain is an algebra with generalized operations of union, intersection, complement, and three constants (0, 1, $n$ which is the fixed point of complement) which can be generalized to an equational class of algebras called DMF-algebras (De Morgan algebras with a~single fixed point of involution) \\cite{Negri1996}. In \\cite{Negri2013} partial sets and DMF-algebras were considered as a~basis for unification of set-theoretic and linguistic approaches to probability. \\par Partial predicates over classes of mathematical models of data were used for formalizing semantics of computer programs in the composition-nominative approach to program formalization \\cite{Nikitch98, NikitchShkilniak2008, Skobelev2014, DBLP:journals/csjm/IvanovNS16}, for formalizing extensions of the Floyd-Hoare logic \\cite{Floyd1967,Hoare1969} which allow reasoning about properties of programs in the case of partial pre- and postconditions \\cite{Kryvolap2013, KornilowiczetalICTERI2017,KornilowiczKNI17,Kornilowicz2018}, for formalizing dynamical models with partial behaviors in the context of the mathematical systems theory \\cite{Ivanov2014,Ivanov2014a,PETERSON.ABS,Ivanov2016, DBLP:journals/corr/Ivanov17}.

This property of graphs is so obvious that the author of this article has yet to find a reference where it is mentioned explicitly. In introductionary books (like \\cite{SIMPLE}, \\cite{MULTI}) as well as in advanced ones (like \\cite{SELECTED}), after the initial definition of graphs the examples are usually given by graphical representations rather than explicit set theoretic descriptions, assuming a mutual understanding how the representation is to be translated into a description fitting the definition. However, Mizar does not possess this innate ability of humans to translate pictures into graphs. Therefore, if one wants to create graphs in Mizar without directly providing a set theoretic description (i.e. using the {\\texttt{createGraph}} functor), a rigorous approach to the constructing operations is required.\\par In this paper supergraphs are defined as an inverse mode to subgraphs as given in \\cite{GLIB_000.ABS}. The three graph construction operations are defined as modes extending {\\texttt{Supergraph}} similar to how the various remove operations were introduced as submodes of {\\texttt{Subgraph}} in \\cite{GLIB_000.ABS}. Many theorems are proven that describe how graph properties are transferred to special supergraphs. In particular, to prove that disconnected graphs cannot become connected by adding an edge between two vertices that lie in the same component, the theory of replacing a part of a walk with another walk is introduced in the preliminaries.",

In this paper another such operation is formalized: Drawing a vertex and then immediately drawing edges connecting this vertex with a subset of the other vertices of the graph. In case the new vertex is joined with all vertices of a given graph $G$, this is known as the join of $G$ and the trivial loopless graph $K_1$. While the join of two graphs is known and found in standard literature (like \\cite{SIMPLE}, \\cite{MULTI} and \\cite{SELECTED}), the operation discribed in this article is not.\\par Alongside the new operation a mode to reverse the directions of a subset of the edges of a graph is introduced. When all edge directions of a graph are reversed, this is commonly known as the converse of a (directed) graph. ",

In this formalization, we express these relations in terms of Diophantine set introduced in \\cite{HILB10_2.ABS}. We prove that these relations are Diophantine and then we prove several second-order theorems that provide the ability to combine Diophantine relation using conjunctions and alternatives as well as to substitute the right-hand side of a given Diophantine equality as an argument in a given Diophantine relation. Finally, we investigate the possibilities of our approach to prove that the two equations, being the main purpose of this formalization, are Diophantine. \\par The formalization follows Z.

            "summary": "This is the first part of a four-article series containing a Mizar formalization of Kronecker's construction about roots of polynomials in field extensions, i.e. that for every field $F$ and every polynomial $p \\in F[X] \\backslash F$ there exists a field extension $E$ of $F$ such that $p$ has a root over $E$. The formalization follows Kronecker's classical proof using $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$ as the desired field extension $E$.\\par In this first part we show that an irreducible polynomial $p \\in F[X] \\backslash F$ has a root over $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$. Note, however, that this statement cannot be true in a rigid formal sense: We do not have $F \\subseteq F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$ as sets, so $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$, and hence formally $p$ is not even a polynomial over $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$. Consequently, we translate $p$ along the canonical monomorphism $\\phi : F \\longrightarrow F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$ and show that the translated polynomial $\\phi(p)$ has a root over $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$. \\par Because $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$ we construct in the second part the field $(E\\, \\backslash \\, \\phi(F)) \\cup F$ for a given monomorphism $\\phi : F \\longrightarrow E$ and show that this field both is isomorphic to $F$ and includes $F$ as a subfield. In the literature this part of the proof usually consists of saying that ``one can identify $F$ with its image $\\phi(F)$ in $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$ and therefore consider $F$ as a subfield of $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$\". Interestingly, to do so we need to assume that $F \\cap E = \\emptyset$, in particular Kronecker's construction can be formalized for fields $F$ with $F \\cap F[X] = \\emptyset$. \\par Surprisingly, as we show in the third part, this condition is not automatically true for arbitray fields $F$: With the exception of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ we construct for every field $F$ an isomorphic copy $F'$ of $F$ with $F' \\cap F'[X] \\neq \\emptyset$. We also prove that for Mizar's representations of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ we have $\\mathbb{Z}_n \\cap \\mathbb{Z}_n[X] = \\emptyset$, $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap \\mathbb{Q}[X] = \\emptyset$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\cap \\mathbb{R}[X] = \\emptyset$, respectively. \\par In the fourth part we finally define field extensions: $E$ is a field extension of $F$ iff $F$ is a subfield of $E$. Note, that in this case we have $F \\subseteq E$ as sets, and thus a polynomial $p$ over $F$ is also a polynomial over $E$. We then apply the construction of the second part to $F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$ with the canonical monomorphism $\\phi : F \\longrightarrow F[X]/\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$. Together with the first part this gives -- for fields $F$ with $F \\cap F[X] = \\emptyset$ - a field extension $E$ of $F$ in which $p \\in F[X] \\backslash F$ has a root.",

In the literature a mutual understanding how the graphical representation of graphs is to be translated into a description fitting the set-theoretic definition is usually assumed (cf. \\cite{SIMPLE,MULTI,GERWAG,SELECTED}), but in Mizar we need explicit operations.\\par For certain types of finite graphs (e.g. simple or connected) and for finite graphs in general, finite graph sequences are given to construct the graph from $K_1$ or a certain subgraph using only a selection of the operations. The length of these sequences is given depending only on the order and size of the graph to be constructed. From these theorems schemes are derived providing easier methods to prove properties of such graphs given that they hold for $K_1$ and the corresponding basic operations needed to construct such graphs.\\par In the preliminaries many miscellaneous graph facts are proven.

Interestingly, to do so we need to assume that $F \\cap E = \\emptyset$, in particular Kronecker's construction can be formalized for fields $F$ with $F \\cap F[X] = \\emptyset$.\\par Surprisingly, as we show in the third part, this condition is not automatically true for arbitrary fields $F$: With the exception of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ we construct for every field $F$ an isomorphic copy $F'$ of $F$ with $F' \\cap F'[X] \\neq \\emptyset$. We also prove that for Mizar's representations of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ we have $\\mathbb{Z}_n \\cap \\mathbb{Z}_n[X] = \\emptyset$, $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap \\mathbb{Q}[X] = \\emptyset$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\cap \\mathbb{R}[X] = \\emptyset$, respectively.\\par In this fourth part we finally define field extensions: $E$ is a field extension of $F$ iff $F$ is a subfield of $E$. Note, that in this case we have $F \\subseteq E$ as sets, and thus a polynomial $p$ over $F$ is also a polynomial over $E$. We then apply the construction of the second part to $F[X]\\slash\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\! \\!>$ with the canonical monomorphism $\\phi : F \\longrightarrow F[X]\\slash\\!\\!<\\!\\!p\\!\\!>$. Together with the first part this gives -- for fields $F$ with $F \\cap F[X] = \\emptyset$ -- a field extension $E$ of $F$ in which $p \\in F[X] \\backslash F$ has a root.",

            "summary": "In the Mizar Mathematical Library\\cite{BancerekJAR:2018} there are several formalizations of graphs with a varying degree of generality, see \\cite{TREES_1.ABS,GRAPH_1.ABS,SGRAPH1.ABS,GLIB_000.ABS,SCMYCIEL.ABS}. The \\texttt{GLIB\\_} series (starting with \\cite{GLIB_000.ABS}) formalizes general digraphs (that is, digraphs with loops and parallel edges allowed) in Mizar\\cite{FourDecades} and provides a rich notation so that any digraph in Mizar can be seen as an undirected graph simply by ignoring the direction of the edges (although they are always there). In conclusion, there is no need for another formalization of undirected graphs, in contrast to how it is typically done in the literature (cf. \\cite{SIMPLE,SELECTED}), and the underlying (undirected) graph of a digraph (in the sense of \\cite{GLIB_000.ABS}) is itself. For undirected graphs or digraphs possibly containing loops and multiple parallel edges, the underlying (simple) graph or digraph is derived by removing the loops and replacing each set of parallel edges with a single edge. That concept requires formalization and this article provides subgraph modes that respectively remove loops, (directed) parallel edges or both from a given (di)graph. \"Much of graph theory is concerned with the study of simple graphs\"\\cite[p.~3]{MULTI} which results in many books only studying simple graphs, even when graphs are more generally introduced in the respective book (for example \\cite{GERWAG}). The aim of this article was to ease the transition from simple graphs to general graphs in the formalization process of graph theory in Mizar.\\par In addition to the notion of underlying graphs this article also introduces plain graphs, i.e. graphs without decorators as introduced in \\cite{GLIB_003.ABS}. This is important for building sets consisting of graphs fulfilling certain properties. The set of all loops of a graph is formally introduced as well. ",

            "summary": "Writing this article has been rather challenging. \"Much of graph theory is concerned with the study of simple graphs\"\\cite[p.~3]{MULTI}, so most graph theory books are only concerned with graph homomorphisms between simple graphs, if they are concerned with anything more general than isomorphisms at all. \\cite{MULTI} writes about general graphs; isomorphisms are done in the first chapter while homomorphisms are only looked at in the context of vertex colorings in chapter~14. The book \"Graphs and homomorphisms\"\\cite{HOMO} only handles (di)graphs without multiple parallel edges. The book \"Graph coloring problems\"\\cite{COLPROB} notes homomorphisms between loopless graphs, but doesn't elaborate. \\cite{AGT2} only handles homomorphisms between simple graphs. \\cite{CAYLEY} shortly describes homomorphisms between undirected graphs. \\cite{EXPATH} handles homomorphisms between digraphs without parallel edges. \\cite{SIMPLE} writes about general graphs but, like most graph books, only about isomorphisms. The best source so far has been \\cite{AGT}, where graph homomorphisms are introduced for digraphs possibly containing loops and multiple parallel edges (just like graphs are formalized in \\cite{GLIB_000.ABS}) but the focus is almost immediately shifted to homomorphisms between simple graphs. So a quick overview of the formalized notation seems in order.\\par A \\textit{graph} $G$ consists of a non empty set $V(G)$ called vertices of $G$, a set $E(G)$ called edges of $G$ and two functions $s(G),t(G):E(G)\\rightarrow V(G)$, the source and target of $G$. For $e\\in E(G),v,w\\in V(G)$ we write \\textit{$e$ joins $v$ to $w$} if $s(G)(e)=v$ and $t(G)(e)=w$, and we write \\textit{$e$ joins $v$ and $w$} if $e$ joins $v$ to $w$ or $e$ joins $w$ to $v$. Let $G_1,G_2$ be graphs. A \\textit{partial graph mapping} from $G_1$ to $G_2$ is an ordered pair $F=[F_V,F_E]$ with the following properties: \\begin{itemize} \\item $F_V$ is a partial function from $V(G_1)$ to $V(G_2)$. \\item $F_E$ is a partial function from $E(G_1)$ to $E(G_2)$. \\item For any $e\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_E$ holds $s(G)(e),t(G)(e)\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_V$. \\item For any $e\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_E$ and $v,w\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_V$ such that $e$ joins $v$ and $w$ holds $F_E(e)$ joins $F_V(v)$ and $F_V(w)$. \\end{itemize} Note that $[f,\\emptyset]$ is a valid partial graph mapping for any partial function $f:V(G_1)\\to V(G_2)$, especially for $f=\\emptyset$. Now define the following attributes: \\begin{itemize} \\item $F$ is \\textit{empty} if $\\operatorname{dom}F_V=\\emptyset$. \\item $F$ is \\textit{total} (or a homomorphism) if $\\operatorname{dom}F_V=V(G_1)$ and $\\operatorname{dom}F_E=E(G_1)$. \\item $F$ is \\textit{onto} (or surjective) if $\\operatorname{rng}F_V=V(G_2)$ and $\\operatorname{rng}F_E=E(G_2)$. \\item $F$ is \\textit{one-to-one} (or injective) if $F_V$ and $F_E$ are. \\item $F$ is \\textit{semi-continuous} if for any $e\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_E$ and $v,w\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_V$ such that $F_E(e)$ joins $F_V(v)$ and $F_V(w)$ holds $e$ joins $v$ and $w$. \\item $F$ is \\textit{continuous} if for any $\\tilde{e}\\in E(G_2)$ and $v,w\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_V$ such that $\\tilde{e}$ joins $F_V(v)$ and $F_V(w)$ exists an $e\\in\\operatorname{dom}F_E$ such that $F_E(e)=\\tilde{e}$ and $e$ joins $v$ and $w$. \\item $F$ is a \\textit{weak subgraph-embedding} if it is total and one-to-one. \\item $F$ is a \\textit{strong subgraph-embedding} if it is total, one-to-one and continuous. \\item $F$ is an \\textit{isomorphism} if it is total, one-to-one and onto. \\end{itemize} Because modes in Mizar must always be inhabitated, partial graph mappings are the chosen foundation rather than homomorphisms, which may not exist between two graphs. The attributes \\textit{total}, \\textit{onto} and \\textit{one-to-one} were named like their function analogons from \\cite{FUNCT_1.ABS} and \\cite{FUNCT_2.ABS}. The \\textit{continuous} attribute was inspired by the continuous vertex mappings of \\cite{AGT} and is in fact sometimes different from \\textit{semi-continuous}. \\textit{Semi-continuous} seemed like the natural generalization of \\textit{continuous} for graph mappings instead of vertex mappings, but that turned out to be false. Still, a semi-continuous graph mapping already carries a lot of properties from $G_1$ to $G_2$, so the definition was kept. Corresponding attributes for directed graph mappings are given as well in this article.\\par If $F$ is a weak subgraph-embedding, then $G_1$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $G_2$. If $F$ is a strong subgraph-embedding, then $G_1$ is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of $G_2$. The short term \\textit{embedding} was desperately avoided to be available for embeddings of graphs into the plane and other surfaces. If $F$ is one-to-one, it is also semi-continuous. If $F$ is semi-continuous and onto, it is also continuous.\\par Originally, only an article about graph isomorphisms was planned, but it was changed to provide a solid foundation of general graph mappings. Now this article also includes the restriction of $F$ to subgraphs of $G_1$ or $G_2$, the domain and range of $F$ defined as the plain subgraphs of $G_1$ and $G_2$ induced by $\\operatorname{dom}F_V$, $\\operatorname{dom}F_E$ and $\\operatorname{rng}F_V$, $\\operatorname{rng}F_E$ respectively, and the images of walks under $F$. Of course the inverse of $F$ and the composition of two graph mappings are included as well. \\par Additionally, the ordering of a graph, which is just an enumeration of its vertices, has been introduced as yet another graph decorator. Attributes describing if $F$ preserves the weights, edge labels, vertex labels or the ordering have been added as well. ",

            "summary": "This article is a brief introduction to partial vertex mappings in Mizar\\cite{FourDecades}. As discussed in the abstract of \\cite{GLIB_010.ABS} almost no graph theory book discusses graph homomorphisms in a scope as general as it was done in \\cite{AGT} and \\cite{GLIB_010.ABS}. Most of the time, graph homomorphisms are only discussed in the form of vertex mappings, often only in the context of simple graphs. But of course that choice is not without reason and in many cases considering vertex mappings is enough, which is especially useful since one does not need to think about an edge mapping then. Given that the graph definitions change slightly between different authors, a quick overview of the formalized notation seems in order.\\par A \\textit{partial vertex mapping} $f$ between two graphs $G_1$, $G_2$ is a partial function of their vertex sets $V(G_1)$, $V(G_2)$ with the additional property that if vertices $v,w\\in\\operatorname{dom}f$ are adjacent in $G_1$, then their images $f(v)$, $f(w)$ are adjacent in $G_2$. The properties of $f$ to be \\textit{total} (or a homomorphism), \\textit{one-to-one} (or injective) and \\textit{onto} (or surjective) have the usual meaning for $f$ as a partial function. $f$ is \\textit{continuous} if for any $v,w\\in\\operatorname{dom}f$ such that $f(v)$ and $f(w)$ are adjacent, $v$ and $w$ are adjacent as well. $f$ is an \\textit{isomorphism} if it is total, one-to-one, onto and the cardinality of edges between to vertices $v$ and $w$ of $G_1$ is the same as the cardinality of the edges between $f(v)$ and $f(w)$. Corresponding attributes for directed vertex mappings are given as well in this article.\\par The attribute \\textit{continuous} is the generalization for not necessarily simple graphs of the \\textit{continuous} of \\cite{AGT}. The \\textit{isomorphism} attribute was inspired by \\cite{DISC} and it is shown that for graphs $G_1, G_2$ without multiple edges that a total bijective and continuous vertex mapping $f$ between them is already an isomorphism, just like a graph isomorphism is usually described (cf. \\cite{HOMO,SIMPLE,AGT}). This article does not go into depth like \\cite{GLIB_010.ABS}, but the inverse and composition of partial vertex mappings are covered.\\par A partial graph mapping does not always induce a partial vertex mapping (since any subset of the set of edges of $G_1$ can be mapped) and a partial vertex mapping can give rise to several partial graph mappings. In the second part of this article it is shown in which cases that the induced partial vertex mapping exists and the induced partial graph mapping is unique. Furthermore it is formally stated that for two graphs without multiple edges there exists a graph mapping that is an isomorphism iff there exists a vertex mapping that is an isomorphism. ",

From the above, the authors first determined the length of the interval by the outer measure. Specifically, we used the compactness of the real space. Next, we constructed the pre-measure by limiting the outer measure to a semialgebra of intervals.

A drawback of our formalization was that it works only for polynomial-disjoint fields, that is for fields $F$ with $F \\cap F[X] = \\emptyset$. The main purpose of Kronecker's construction is that by induction one gets a field extension of $F$ in which $p$ splits into linear factors. For our formalization this means that the constructed field extension $E$ again has to be polynomial-disjoint.\\par In this article we first analyze whether our formalization can be extended that way. Using the field of polynomials over $F$ with degree smaller than the degree of $p$ to construct the field extension $E$ does not work: In this case $E$ is polynomial-disjoint if and only if $p$ is linear. Using $F[x]\\backslash $ one can show that for $F = \\mathbb{Q} and $F = \\mathbb{Z}_n$ the constructed field extension $E$ is again polynomial-disjoint, so that in particular algebraic number fields can be handled.\\par For the general case we then introduce renamings of sets $X$ as injective functions $f$ with dom$(f) = X$ and rng$(f) \\cap (X \\cup Z) = \\emptyset$ for an arbitrary set $Z$. This, finally, allows to construct a field extension $E$ of an arbitrary field $F$ in which a given polynomial $p \\in F[x] \\backslash F$ splits into linear factors. Note, however, that to prove the existence of renamings we had to rely on the axiom of choice.",

However, the foundation explicitly refers only to Tarski's Axiom A, which states that for every set $X$ there is a Tarski universe $U$ such that $X\\in U$. In this article, we prove, using the Mizar\\cite{Role_MML} formalism, that the Grothendieck name is justified. We show the relationship between Tarski and Grothendieck universe.\\par First we prove in Theorem~\\ref{Th17} that every Grothendieck universe satisfies Tarski's Axiom A. Then in Theorem~\\ref{Th18} we prove that every Grothendieck universe that contains a given set $X$, even the least (with respect to inclusion) denoted by \\texttt{GrothendieckUniverse}$\\:X$, has as a subset the least (with respect to inclusion) Tarski universe that contains $X$, denoted by the \\texttt{Tarski-Class}$\\:X$. Since Tarski universes, as opposed to Grothendieck universes, might not be transitive (called \\texttt{epsilon-transitive} in the MML) we focused our attention to demonstrate that \\texttt{Tarski-Class}$\\:X\\: \\varsubsetneq\\:$\\texttt{GrothendieckUniverse}$\\:X$ for some $X$. We show in Theorem~\\ref{Th19} that \\texttt{Tarski-Class}$\\:X$ where $X$ is the singleton of any infinite set is a proper subset of \\texttt{GrothendieckUniverse}$\\:X$. Finally we show that \\texttt{Tarski-Class}$\\:X\\:=\\:$\\texttt{GrothendieckUniverse}$\\:X$ holds under the assumption that $X$ is a transitive set. \\par The formalisation is an extension of the formalisation used in \\cite{CBKP-CICM/MKM19}.",

            "summary": "Jozef Bialas and Yatsuka Nakamura has completely formalized a proof of Urysohn's lemma in the article \\cite{URYSOHN3.ABS}, in the context of a topological space defined from the open sets. In the MML, the topological space is defined in this way by Beata Padlewska and Agata Darmochwa\\l in the article \\cite{PRE_TOPC.ABS}. In \\cite{FINTOPO7.ABS} the topological space is defined with neighborhoods. It is well known that these definitions are equivalent \\cite{Bourbaki2013general,bourbaki2007topologie}. \\par In the definitions, an abstract structure (i.e. the article \\verb!STRUCT_0! and its descendants, all of them directly or indirectly using Mizar structures \\cite{bancerek2018role}) has been used (see \\cite{Grabowski2020}). The first topological definition is based with the Mizar structure {\\tt TopStruct} and the topological space defined with neighborhood with the Mizar structure: \\textit{FMT_Space_Str}. To emphasize the notion of neighborhood, we rename {\\tt FMT_TOPSPACE} to {\\tt NTopSpace}.\\par Using Mizar \\cite{Mizar-State-2015}, we transport the Urysohn's lemma from {\\tt TopSpace} to {\\tt NTopSpace}.\\par In some cases, Mizar allows certain techniques for transporting proof, definitions or theorems. Generally speaking, there is no automatic transport but some methods. \\par In Coq, Isabelle/Hol or homotpy type theory transport is also studied, sometimes with a more systematic aim \\cite{magaud2003changing,zimmermann2015automatic, huffman2013lifting,johnsen2004theorem,coquand2014theorie, tabareau2018equivalences}. In \\cite{chad_brown_2019_3548609}, two co-existing Isabelle libraries, Isabelle/HOL and Isabelle/Mizar, have been aligned in a single foundation in the Isabelle logical framework.\\par In the MML, they have been used since the beginning: {\\tt reconsider}, {\\tt registration}, {\\tt cluster} others were later implemented \\cite{Korni2009}: {\\tt identify}.\\par In some proofs, it is possible to define particular functors between different structures, mainly useful when results are already obtained in a given structure. This technique is used, for example, in \\cite{MATRIXR1.ABS} to define two functors {\\tt MXR2MXF} and {\\tt MXF2MXF} between {\\tt Matrix of REAL} and {\\tt Matrix of F_Real} and to transport the definition of the addition from one structure to the other: [...] {\\tt A + B -> Matrix of REAL equals MXF2MXR ((MXR2MXF A) + (MXR2MXF B))} [...].\\par In this paper, first we align the necessary topological concepts. For the formalization, we were inspired by the works of Claude Wagschal \\cite{wagschal}. It allows us to transport more naturally the Urysohn's lemma (\\verb!URYSOHN3:20!) to the topological space defined with neighborhoods.\\par Nakasho and Shidama have developed a solution to explore the notions introduced by different authors \\url{https://mimosa-project.github.io/mmlreference/current/}\\cite {nakasho2015documentation}.\\par The definitions can be directly linked in the HTML version of the Mizar library.

An instance is a sequence of items, each being of positive size at most one. The task is to place all the items into bins so that the total size of items in each bin is at most one and the number of bins that contain at least one item is minimum.\\par Approximation algorithms have been intensively studied. Algorithm NextFit would be the simplest one. The algorithm repeatedly does the following: If the first unprocessed item in the sequence can be placed, in terms of size, additionally to the bin into which the algorithm has placed an item the last time, place the item into that bin; otherwise place the item into an empty bin. Johnson~\\cite{johnson1973near} proved that the number of the resulting bins by algorithm NextFit is less than twice the number of the fewest bins that are needed to contain all items.\\par In this article, we formalize the bin packing problem as follows: An instance is a sequence of positive real numbers that are each at most one. The task is to find a function that maps the indices of the sequence to positive integers such that the sum of the subsequence for each of the inverse images is at most one and the size of the image is minimum. We then formalize algorithm NextFit, its feasibility, its approximation guarantee, and the tightness of the approximation guarantee.",

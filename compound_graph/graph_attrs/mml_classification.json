We feel free to use any standard set-theoretic notation without explicit use of indices'' \\cite[p.~97]{Tar-Wir1}. The aim of this work was to check the feasibility of such approach in Mizar. It works.\\par Let us observe some peculiarities: \\begin{itemize} \\item[-] empty set (i.e. the many sorted set with empty set of indices) belongs to itself (theorem 133), \\item[-] we get two different inclusions $X \\subseteq Y$ iff $\\forall_{i \\in I} X_i \\subseteq Y_i$ and $X \\sqsubseteq Y$ iff $\\forall_x x \\in X \\Rightarrow x \\in Y$ equivalent only for sets that yield non empty values. \\end{itemize} Therefore the care is advised.",

        "summary": "This is an experimental article which shows that logical correctness of logic circuits can be easily proven by the Mizar system. First, we define the notion of logic gates. Then we prove that an MSB carry of `4 Bit Carry Skip Adder' is equivalent to an MSB carry of a normal 4 bit adder. In the last theorem, we show that outputs of the `4 Bit Carry Look Ahead Adder' are equivalent to the corresponding outputs of the normal 4 bits adder. The policy here is as follows: when the functional (semantic) correctness of a system is already proven, and the correspondence of the system to a (normal) logic circuit is given, it is enough to prove the correctness of the new circuit if we only prove the logical equivalence between them. Although the article is very fundamental (it contains few environment files), it can be applied to real problems. The key of the method introduced here is to put the specification of the logic circuit into the Mizar propositional formulae, and to use the strong inference ability of the Mizar checker. The proof is done formally so that the automation of the proof writing is possible. Even in the 5.3.07 version of Mizar, it can handle a formulae of more than 100 lines, and a formula which contains more than 100 variables. This means that the Mizar system is enough to prove logical correctness of middle scaled logic circuits.",

The proof of the sufficiency is by induction on the number of elements of $D$. A.~M\\c{a}kowski and K.~Wi{\\'s}niewski \\cite{maw69} have shown that the assumption of finiteness is superfluous. They proved their version of the theorem for $f$ being a function from $D$ into $D$. In the proof, the required partition was constructed and the construction used the axiom of choice. Their main point was to demonstrate that the use of this axiom in the proof is essential. We have proved in Mizar the generalized version of Abian's theorem, i.e. without assuming finiteness of $D$. We have simplified the proof from \\cite{maw69} which uses well-ordering principle and transfinite ordinals---our proof does not use these notions but otherwise is based on their idea (we employ choice functions).",

In our approach, we model graph structure as a finite function whose domain is a subset of natural numbers. The elements of the domain of the function play the role of selectors for accessing the components of the structure. As these selectors are first class objects, many future extensions of the new graph structure turned out to be easier to formalize in Mizar than with the traditional Mizar structures. \\par After introducing graph structure, we define its selectors and then conditions that the structure needs to satisfy to form a directed graph (in the spirit of \\cite{GRAPH_1.ABS}). For these graphs we define a collection of basic graph notions; the presentation of these notions is continued in articles \\cite{GLIB_001.ABS,GLIB_002.ABS,GLIB_003.ABS}. \\par We have tried to follow a number of graph theory books in choosing graph terminology but since the terminology is not commonly agreed upon, we had to make a number of compromises, see \\cite{gl04}.",

The formalization of the notion as classical as the Lebesgue measure determines the powers of the PC Mizar system as a tool for the strict, precise notation and verification of the correctness of deductive theories. Following the successive articles \\cite{SUPINF_1.ABS}, \\cite{SUPINF_2.ABS}, \\cite{MEASURE1.ABS}, \\cite{MEASURE6.ABS} constructed so that the final one should include the definition and the basic properties of the Lebesgue measure, we observe one of the paths relatively simple in the sense of the definition, enabling us the formal introduction of this notion. This way, although toilsome, since such is the nature of formal theories, is greatly instructive. It brings home the proper succession of the introduction of the definitions of intermediate notions and points out to those elements of the theory which determine the essence of the complexity of the notion being introduced.\\par The paper includes the definition of the $\\sigma$-field of Lebesgue measurable sets, the definition of the Lebesgue measure and the basic set of the theorems describing its properties.",

This article is a follow-up to \\cite{ASYMPT_0.ABS} in which we introduced the basic notions and general theory. This article presents a Mizar formalization of examples and solutions to problems from Chapter 3 of \\cite{BraBra96} (some of the examples and solved problems are also in \\cite{ASYMPT_0.ABS}). Not all problems have been solved as some required solutions not amenable for formalization.",

        "summary": "Non overwriting program is a program where each variable used in it is written only just one time, but the control variables used for ``for-statement'' are exceptional. Contrarily, variables are allowed to be read many times. There are other restrictions for the non overwriting program. For statements, only the following are allowed: ``substituting-statement'', ``if-else-statement'', ``for-statement'' (with break and without break), function (correct one) -- ``call-statement'' and ``return-statement''. Grammar of non overwriting program is like the one of the C-language. For type of variables, ``int'', ``real\", ``char'' and ``float'' can be used, and array of them can also be used. For operation, ``+'', ``$-$'' and ``*'' are used for a type ``int''; ``+'', ``$-$'', ``*'' and ``/'' are used for a type ``float''. User can also define structures like in C. Non overwriting program can be translated to (predicative) logic formula in definition part to define functions. If a new function is correctly defined, a corresponding program is correct, if it does not use arrays. If it uses arrays, area check is necessary in the following theorem.\\par Semantic correctness is shown by some theorems following the definition. These theorems must tie up the result of the program and mathematical concepts introduced before. Correctness is proven {\\it function-wise}. We must use only {\\it correctness-proven} functions to define a new function (to write a new program as a form of a function). Here, we present two programs of division function of two natural numbers and of two integers. An algorithm is checked for each case by proving correctness of the definitions. We also perform an area check of the index of arrays used in one of the programs.",

That theory works with universal class which consists of all sets and every class is a subclass of it.

The sets are introduced in \\cite{CLASSES2.ABS} and some concepts of MK are modeled. The concepts are: the class $On$ of all ordinal numbers belonging to the universe, subclasses, transfinite sequences of non-empty elements of universe, etc. The reflection theorem states that if $A_\\xi$ is an increasing and continuous transfinite sequence of non-empty sets and class $A = \\bigcup_{\\xi \\in On} A_\\xi$, then for every formula $H$ there is a strictly increasing continuous mapping $F: On \\to On$ such that if $\\varkappa$ is a critical number of $F$ (i.e. $F(\\varkappa) = \\varkappa > 0$) and $f \\in A_\\varkappa^{\\bf VAR}$, then $A,f\\models H \\equiv\\ {A_\\varkappa},f\\models H$.

In the first section, we give the mentioned formulation which the author heavily owes to the formalism of Adam Grabowski's \\cite{HILBERT1.ABS}. After the theoretical development of the logic, we prove a number of valid formulas of IPC in the sections 2--4. The last two sections are devoted to present classical propositional calculus and modal calculus S4 in our framework, as a preparation for future study.

We mean by similar formulas the two formulas that differs only in the names of bound variables. Some authors (compare \\cite{RASIOWA-SIKOR}) call such formulas {\\em congruent}. We use the word {\\em similar} following \\cite{POGO:1}, \\cite{POGO:2}, \\cite{POGORZELSKI.1975}. The concept is unjustfully neglected in many logical handbooks. It is intuitively quite clear, however the exact definition is not simple. As far as we know, only W.A.~Pogorzelski and T.~Prucnal \\cite{POGORZELSKI.1975} define it in the precise way. We follow basically the Pogorzelski's definition (compare \\cite{POGO:1}). We define renumeration of bound variables and we say that two formulas are similar if after renumeration are equal. Therefore we need a rule of chosing bound variables independent of the original choice. Quite obvious solution is to use consecutively variables $x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\\dots$, where $k$ is the maximal index of free variable occurring in the formula. Therefore after the renumeration we get the new formula in which different quantifiers bind different variables. It is the reason that the result of renumeration applied to a formula $\\varphi$ we call {\\em $\\varphi$ with variables separated}.",

Besides the a gcd b, Extended Euclidean Algorithm can calculate a pair of two integers (x,y) that holds ax+by = a gcd b. In addition, we formalize an algorithm that can compute a solution of the chinese reminder theorem by using Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Our aim is to support implementation of number theoretic tools. Our formalization of those algorithms are based on the source code of the NZMATH, a number theory oriented calculation system developed by Tokyo Metropolitan University \\cite{NZMATH}.",

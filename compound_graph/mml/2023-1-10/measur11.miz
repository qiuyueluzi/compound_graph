theorem Th72:
for F be disjoint_valued FinSequence, n,m be Nat
  st n < m holds union rng(F|n) misses F.m
proof
   let F be disjoint_valued FinSequence, n,m be Nat;
   assume A1: n < m;
   per cases;
   suppose n >= len F; then
    m > len F by A1,XXREAL_0:2; then
    not m in dom F by FINSEQ_3:25; then
    F.m = {} by FUNCT_1:def 2;
    hence union rng(F|n) misses F.m;
   end;
   suppose A2: n < len F;
    for A be set st A in rng(F|n) holds A misses F.m
    proof
     let A be set;
     assume A in rng(F|n); then
     consider k be object such that

     A = F.k by A3,FINSEQ_3:112;
     hence A misses F.m by A1,A4,PROB_2:def 2;
    end;
    hence union rng(F|n) misses F.m by ZFMISC_1:80;
   end;
end;

theorem Th73:
for F be FinSequence, m,n be Nat st m <= n holds len(F|m) <= len(F|n)
proof
   let F be FinSequence, m,n be Nat;
   assume m <= n; then
   F|m = F|n|m by FINSEQ_1:82;

theorem Th101:
for F be disjoint_valued FinSequence, n be Nat holds
 Union(F|n) misses F.(n+1)
proof
   let F be disjoint_valued FinSequence, n be Nat;
   assume Union(F|n) meets F.(n+1); then

   m <= len(F|n) & len(F|n) <= n by A3,FINSEQ_3:25,FINSEQ_1:86; then
   m <> n+1 by NAT_1:13; then
   F.m misses F.(n+1) by PROB_2:def 2; then

    suppose len F < k+1; then
     (F|(k+1)) = F & F|k = F by FINSEQ_3:49,NAT_1:13;

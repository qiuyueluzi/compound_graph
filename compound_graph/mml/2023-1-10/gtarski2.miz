    let n be Nat;
    let r,s be Real, u,v,w be Element of TOP-REAL n;
    assume r * u - r * v = s * w - s * u;
    then r * u - r * v + s * u = s * w + (- s * u + s * u) by RVSUM_1:15

  proof
    let r,s be Real;
    assume that
A1: 0 < r and
A2: 0 < s;
    thus 0 <= r/(r+s) by A1,A2;
    0 + r <= s + r by A2,XREAL_1:6;
    then r / (r+s) <= (r+s) / (r+s) by A1,XREAL_1:72;

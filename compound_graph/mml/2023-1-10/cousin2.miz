  proof
    assume that
A1: a - b <= c and
A2: b <= a;
    b - b <= a - b by A2,XREAL_1:9; then
A3: 0 <= c by A1;
    (-1) * c <= (-1) * (a - b) by A1,XREAL_1:65; then
A5: -c <= b - a;
    b - a <= a - a by A2,XREAL_1:9;
    hence thesis by ABSVALUE:5,A5,A3;

theorem Th02:
  b - a <= c & a <= b implies |. b - a .| <= c
  proof
    assume that
A1: b - a <= c and
A2: a <= b;
A3: a - a <= b - a by A2,XREAL_1:9;
    then -c <= 0 by A1;

  end;

Lm01:
  a <= b + c & b <= d implies a <= d + c
  proof
    assume
A1: a <= b + c & b <= d;
    then b + c <= d + c by XREAL_1:7;
    hence thesis by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
  end;

Lm02:
  a < b + c & b - c < d implies a - d < 2 * c
  proof
    assume that
A1: a < b + c and
A2: b - c < d;
    a - d < (b + c) - (b - c) by A1,A2,XREAL_1:14;

A3: |.c - d.| <= e;
    b in [.a,c.] & a <= c by A1,XXREAL_1:1,XXREAL_0:2;

  proof

    then
A2: a - b <> 0;
    set e = |.a - b.| / 2;
    2 * e <= e by A1;
    then (2 * e) / e <= e / e by XREAL_1:72;
    then 2 <= e / e by A2,XCMPLX_1:89;
    then 2 <= 1 by A2,XCMPLX_1:60;
    hence contradiction;
  end;

theorem Th05:
  for b,c,d being non negative Real st
  d < e / (2 * b * |. c .|) holds
  b is positive & c is positive
  proof
    let b,c,d be non negative Real;
    assume
A1: d < e / (2 * b * |. c .|);
    assume not (b is positive & c is positive);
    then per cases;

theorem Th06:
  a <> 0 implies a * (b / (2 * a)) = b / 2
  proof
    assume
A1: a <> 0;
    a * (b / (2 * a)) = (a * b) / (a * 2) by XCMPLX_1:74
                     .= (a / a * b) / 2 by XCMPLX_1:83

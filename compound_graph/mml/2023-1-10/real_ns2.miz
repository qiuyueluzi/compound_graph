    for x,y be Element of REAL n
    holds (Euclid_add n).(x,y) = (RealFuncAdd Seg n).(x,y)
    proof
      let x,y be Element of REAL n;
      reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y as Point of TOP-REAL n by A1,REAL_NS1:def 4;
      thus (Euclid_add n).(x,y) = x1 + y1 by REAL_NS1:def 1
      .= (RealFuncAdd Seg n).(x,y) by A2;
    end; then
    Euclid_add n = RealFuncAdd Seg n by A4,BINOP_1:2; then

    for x,y be Element of REAL n holds
        (the distance of Euclid n).(x,y)

    proof
      let x,y be Element of REAL n;
      reconsider x1=x, y1=y as Point of REAL-NS n by REAL_NS1:def 4;
      thus (the distance of Euclid n).(x,y)

      .= ||. x1-y1 .|| by REAL_NS1:1,5
      .= (distance_by_norm_of X).(x,y) by NORMSP_2:def 1;
    end;
    hence thesis by BINOP_1:2,A1;
  end;

theorem
  the TopStruct of TOP-REAL n = TopSpaceNorm REAL-NS n
  proof
    thus the TopStruct of TOP-REAL n
     = TopSpaceMetr(Euclid n) by EUCLID:def 8
    .= TopSpaceNorm(REAL-NS n) by Th2;
  end;

theorem Th4:
  the carrier of TOP-REAL n = the carrier of REAL-NS n

    .= the carrier of the RLSStruct of REAL-NS n by Th1
    .= the carrier of REAL-NS n;
  end;

  end;

theorem Th5:
  the carrier of (n -VectSp_over F_Real) = the carrier of REAL-NS n

    .= the carrier of REAL-NS n by Th4;
  end;

theorem Th6:
  0.(TOP-REAL n) = 0.(REAL-NS n)
  proof
    thus 0.(TOP-REAL n)
     = 0.(the RLSStruct of TOP-REAL n)
    .= 0.(the RLSStruct of REAL-NS n) by Th1
    .= 0.(REAL-NS n);

  proof
    let r be Real,
        q be Element of TOP-REAL n,
        g be Element of REAL-NS n;
    assume
    A1: q = g;

  proof
    let q be Element of TOP-REAL n,
        g be Element of REAL-NS n;
    assume
    A1: q = g;
    thus -q = (-1)*q by RLVECT_1:16
      .= (-1)*g by A1,Th8
      .= -g by RLVECT_1:16;
  end;

theorem
  for p,q be Element of TOP-REAL n,

  proof
    let p,q be Element of TOP-REAL n,
        f,g be Element of REAL-NS n;
    assume
    A1: p=f & q=g; then

    proof
      let x;
     reconsider xx = x as Element of REAL by XREAL_0:def 1;
      assume x in N;
      then x in Z/\dom f;
      hence f.x-f.x0=r-f.x0 by A8
        .=r - r by A8,A11
        .=L.(xx-xx0)+0
        .=L.(x-x0)+R.(x-x0);
    end;
    hence f is_differentiable_in x0;
  end;
  set x0 = the Element of REAL;
  f is_differentiable_in x0 by A9; then
  consider N being Neighbourhood of x0 such that
  N c= dom f and
A12: ex L,R st for x st x in N holds f.x - f.x0 = L.(x-x0) + R.(x-x0);
  consider L,R such that
A13: for x st x in N holds f.x - f.x0 = L.(x-x0) + R.(x-x0) by A12;
  take R;
  consider p such that
A14: for r holds L.r = p*r by Def3;
  f.x0 - f.x0 = L.(x0-x0) + R.(x0-x0) by A13,RCOMP_1:16;
  then
A15: 0 = p*0 + R.0 by A14;
  hence R.0=0;
A16: now

    let h;
A17: s3.1 = 0;
    (h")(#)(R/*h) is convergent by Def2;

      then |.(R/*h).n.|<=(M(#)abs(h)).n by SEQ_1:9;

    end;
    lim h=0;
    then lim abs(h) = |.0 .| by SEQ_4:14

    then
A22: lim (M(#)abs(h)) = M*0 by SEQ_2:8

A23: abs(R/*h) is convergent by A22,A19,SEQ_2:19;
    lim s3 = 0 by A17,SEQ_4:25;
    then lim abs(R/*h)=0 by A22,A19,SEQ_2:20;
    hence R/*h is convergent & lim (R/*h)=R.0 by A15,A23,SEQ_4:15;

    assume that
    rng s1 c= dom R and
A24: s1 is convergent & lim s1 = 0 and
A25: for n being Nat holds s1.n<>0;
    s1 is 0-convergent by A24;
    then s1 is 0-convergent non-zero Real_Sequence by A25,SEQ_1:5;
    hence R/*s1 is convergent & lim (R/*s1)=R.0 by A16;

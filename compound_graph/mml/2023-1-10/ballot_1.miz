begin :: Preliminaries

reserve D,D1,D2 for non empty set,
        d,d1,d2 for XFinSequence of D,
        n,k,i,j for Nat;

theorem Th1: ::: AFINSQ_2:84
  XFS2FS (d|n) = (XFS2FS d) |n by AFINSQ_2:84;

theorem Th2: ::: AFINSQ_1:97
  rng d = rng (XFS2FS d) by AFINSQ_1:97;

theorem 
  for d1 being XFinSequence of D1, d2 being XFinSequence of D2 st
    d1 = d2 holds XFS2FS d1 = XFS2FS d2;

theorem Th4:
  XFS2FS d1 = XFS2FS d2 implies d1 = d2
proof
  assume
A1: XFS2FS d1 = XFS2FS d2;
  set Xd1=XFS2FS d1,Xd2=XFS2FS d2;
A2: len Xd1 = len d1 by AFINSQ_1:def 9;
A3: len Xd2=len d2 by AFINSQ_1:def 9;
  for i st i < len d1 holds d1.i = d2.i
    proof
      let i such that
A4:     i < len d1;
A5:   i+1 <= len d1 by A4,NAT_1:13;
A6:   i+1-'1=i by NAT_D:34;
      then d1.i = Xd1.(i+1) by NAT_1:11,A5,AFINSQ_1:def 9;
      hence thesis by A6,NAT_1:11,A5,A2,A3,A1,AFINSQ_1:def 9;
    end;
    hence thesis by A2,A3,A1,AFINSQ_1:9;
end;

theorem  ::: AFINSQ_2:85
  for D being set
  for d be FinSequence of D holds XFS2FS (FS2XFS d) = d;

theorem Th6:
  for f be FinSequence, x,y be object st rng f c= {x,y} & x<>y
    holds card (f"{x}) + card (f"{y}) = len f
proof
  let f be FinSequence, A,B be object;

  f"{A} misses f"{B}
  proof
    assume f"{A} meets f"{B};

    f.x = A by A7,TARSKI:def 1;

    .= card Seg len f by FINSEQ_1:def 3

end;

theorem Th7:
  for f,g be Function st f is one-to-one
     for x be object st x in dom f holds Coim(f*g,f.x) = Coim(g,x)
proof
  let f,g be Function such that
A1: f is one-to-one;
  let x be object such that
A2: x in dom f;
  set fg=f*g;
  thus Coim(fg,f.x) c= Coim(g,x)

    holds Sum f = r * card (f"{r})
proof

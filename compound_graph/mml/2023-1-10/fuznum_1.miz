definition let F be FuzzySet of REAL;
  attr F is triangular means
    ex a,b,c being Real st F = TriangularFS (a,b,c);
  attr F is trapezoidal means
    ex a,b,c,d being Real st F = TrapezoidalFS (a,b,c,d);
end;

registration
  cluster triangular for FuzzySet of REAL;
  existence
  proof
    take TriangularFS (0,1,2);
    thus thesis;
  end;
  cluster trapezoidal for FuzzySet of REAL;
  existence
  proof
    take TrapezoidalFS (0,1,2,3);
    thus thesis;

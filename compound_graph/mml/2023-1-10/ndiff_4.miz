  proof
    let f1, f2 be PartFunc of REAL, REAL m;
A1: dom(f1-f2) = dom f1 /\ dom f2 by VALUED_2:def 46;
A2: dom(f1+-f2) = dom f1 /\ dom -f2 by VALUED_2:def 45;
A3: dom -f2 = dom f2 by NFCONT_4:def 3;
    now
      let x be object;
      assume
A4:   x in dom(f1-f2); then
A5:   x in dom f2 by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 4; then
A6:   f2.x = f2/.x & (-f2).x = (-f2)/.x by A3,PARTFUN1:def 6;
      thus (f1-f2).x = f1.x - f2.x by A4,VALUED_2:def 46

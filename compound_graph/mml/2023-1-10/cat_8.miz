    assume
A1: f1 |> f2 & f2 |> f3;
    C is left_composable right_composable by CAT_6:def 11;
    then f1(*)f2 |> f3 & f1 |> f2(*)f3 by A1,CAT_6:def 8,def 9;

  proof
    let C be composable with_identities CategoryStr;
    let f1,f2 be morphism of C;
    assume

    then
A2: C is non empty by CAT_6:1;
    thus f1 is identity implies f1(*)f2 = f2
    proof
      assume f1 is identity;
      then dom f1 = f1 by CAT_7:6;
      then cod f2 = f1 by A1,A2,CAT_7:5;
      hence f1(*)f2 = f2 by A2,CAT_7:9;
    end;
    assume f2 is identity;
    then cod f2 = f2 by CAT_7:6;

    hence f1 is identity by A2,CAT_6:def 14;
    f2 is left_identity by A3,CAT_6:9;
    hence f2 is identity by A3,CAT_6:def 14;
    thus thesis by A2,A3;

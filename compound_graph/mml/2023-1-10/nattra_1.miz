theorem Th1:
  for a being Object of A holds [[id a,id a],id a] in the Comp of A
proof
  let a be Object of A;
A1: dom id a = a;
A2: cod id a = a;
  then
A3: [id a,id a] in dom the Comp of A by A1,CAT_1:15;
  (id a)(*)(id a) = id a by A1,CAT_1:22;
  then (the Comp of A).(id a,id a) = id a by A1,A2,CAT_1:16;

proof
  set A = 1Cat(o,m);

    let x be object;
A1: dom id o9 = o9;
A2: cod id o9 = o9;

  thus for a,b being Object of 1Cat(d,id d), a9,b9 being Object of A st a = a9
  & b = b9 holds Hom(a,b) c= Hom(a9,b9)
  proof
    let a,b be Object of 1Cat(d,id d), a9,b9 be Object of A;
    assume that

A2: b = b9;
A3: b9 = d by A2,TARSKI:def 1;

    a9 = d by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
    hence thesis by A3,A4,CAT_1:27;
  end;
  thus the Comp of 1Cat(d,id d) c= the Comp of A
  proof
    let x be object;
    assume x in the Comp of 1Cat(d,id d);
    then x in {[[id d,id d],id d]} by Th2;
    then x = [[id d,id d],id d] by TARSKI:def 1;

proof

    set MB = the set of all id b where b is Object of B;
A1: AB = [:MA,MB:]
    proof
      thus AB c= [:MA,MB:]
      proof
        let x be object;

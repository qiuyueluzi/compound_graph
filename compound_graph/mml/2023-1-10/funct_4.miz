reserve a,b,p,x,x9,x1,x19,x2,y,y9,y1,y19,y2,z,z9,z1,z2 for object,
   X,X9,Y,Y9,Z,Z9 for set;

reserve f,g,h for Function;

Lm1:
for x,y,x1,y1,x9,y9,x19,y19 being object holds
[[x,x9],[y,y9]] = [[x1,x19],[y1,y19]] implies x = x1 & y = y1 & x9= x19 &

proof let x,y,x1,y1,x9,y9,x19,y19 be object;
  assume [[x,x9],[y,y9]] = [[x1,x19],[y1,y19]];

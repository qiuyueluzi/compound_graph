  let X be non empty set, f be nonnegative PartFunc of X,ExtREAL;
  cluster -f -> nonpositive;
  correctness
  proof
    -f = (-1)(#)f by MESFUNC2:9;
    hence -f is nonpositive by MESFUNC5:20;
  end;
end;

registration
  let X be non empty set, f be nonpositive PartFunc of X,ExtREAL;
  cluster -f -> nonnegative;
  correctness
  proof
    for x be object st x in dom (-f) holds 0 <= (-f).x
    proof
      let x be object;
      assume A1: x in dom(-f);
      f.x <= 0 by MESFUNC5:8; then
      -(f.x) >= 0;
      hence (-f).x >= 0 by A1,MESFUNC1:def 7;
    end;
    hence -f is nonnegative by SUPINF_2:52;
  end;
end;

theorem Th1:
  for X be non empty set, f be nonpositive PartFunc of X,ExtREAL, E be set
    holds f|E is nonpositive
proof
  let X be non empty set, f be nonpositive PartFunc of X,ExtREAL, E be set;
  now let x be set;
    assume x in dom(f|E); then
    (f|E).x = f.x by FUNCT_1:47;
    hence (f|E).x <= 0 by MESFUNC5:8;
  end;
  hence f|E is nonpositive by MESFUNC5:9;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for X be non empty set, A be set, r be Real, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL
    holds (r(#)f)|A = r(#)(f|A)
proof
  let X be non empty set, A be set, r be Real, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL;
A1: dom(r(#)f) = dom f by MESFUNC1:def 6; then
A2: dom((r(#)f)|A) = dom f /\ A by RELAT_1:61; then
A3: dom((r(#)f)|A) = dom(f|A) by RELAT_1:61; then
A4: dom((r(#)f)|A) = dom(r(#)(f|A)) by MESFUNC1:def 6;
    now let x be Element of X;
     assume B1: x in dom((r(#)f)|A); then
B2:  x in dom f by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
     ((r(#)f)|A).x = (r(#)f).x by B1,FUNCT_1:47; then
     ((r(#)f)|A).x = r * f.x by B2,A1,MESFUNC1:def 6; then
     ((r(#)f)|A).x = r * (f|A).x by B1,A3,FUNCT_1:47;
     hence ((r(#)f)|A).x = (r(#)(f|A)).x by B1,A4,MESFUNC1:def 6;
    end;
    hence (r(#)f)|A = r(#)(f|A) by A4,PARTFUN1:5;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for X be non empty set, A be set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL
     holds -(f|A) = (-f)|A
proof
  let X be non empty set, A be set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL;
  -(f|A) = (-1)(#)(f|A) by MESFUNC2:9; then
  -(f|A) = ((-1)(#)f)|A by Th2;
  hence thesis by MESFUNC2:9;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for X be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL,c be Real st
  f is nonpositive holds
  (0 <= c implies c(#)f is nonpositive) &
  (c <= 0 implies c(#)f is nonnegative)
proof
  let X be non empty set;
  let f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL;
  let c be Real;
  set g = c(#)f;
  assume
A1: f is nonpositive;
  hereby
    set g = c(#)f;
    assume
A2: 0 <= c;
    for x be set st x in dom g holds g.x <= 0
    proof
      let x be set;
      f.x <= 0 by A1,MESFUNC5:8; then
A3:   c*f.x <= 0 by A2;
      assume x in dom g;
      hence thesis by A3,MESFUNC1:def 6;
    end;
    hence c(#)f is nonpositive by MESFUNC5:9;
  end;
  assume
A4: c <= 0;
  now
    let x be object;
    f.x <= 0 by A1,MESFUNC5:8; then
A5: 0 <= c*f.x by A4;
    assume x in dom g;
    hence 0 <= g.x by A5,MESFUNC1:def 6;
  end;
  hence thesis by SUPINF_2:52;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for X be non empty set, S be SigmaField of X, M be sigma_Measure of S,
      f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL holds
  max+f is nonnegative & max-f is nonnegative &
    |.f.| is nonnegative
proof
    let X be non empty set, S be SigmaField of X, M be sigma_Measure of S,
    f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL;
A1: for x be object st x in dom max- f holds 0<= (max-f).x by MESFUNC2:13;
    for x be object st x in dom max+ f holds 0<= (max+f).x by MESFUNC2:12;
    hence max+f is nonnegative & max-f is nonnegative by A1,SUPINF_2:52;
    now
     let x be object;
     assume x in dom |.f.|;
     then (|.f.|).x =|. f.x .| by MESFUNC1:def 10;
     hence 0 <= (|.f.|).x by EXTREAL1:14;
    end;
    hence thesis by SUPINF_2:52;
end;

theorem
  for X be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL, x be object holds
    f.x <= (max+f).x & f.x >= -(max-f).x
proof
    let X be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL, x be object;
    per cases;
    suppose x in dom f; then
     x in dom(max+f) & x in dom(max-f) by MESFUNC2:def 2,def 3; then
A1:  (max+f).x = max(f.x,0) & (max-f).x = max(-f.x,0)
       by MESFUNC2:def 2,def 3;
     reconsider a = (max-f).x, b = -(f.x) as ExtReal;
     -b >= -a by A1,XXREAL_0:25,XXREAL_3:38;
     hence f.x <= (max+f).x & f.x >= -(max-f).x by A1,XXREAL_0:25;
    end;
    suppose A2: not x in dom f; then
     not x in dom(max+f) & not x in dom(max-f) by MESFUNC2:def 2,def 3; then
     f.x = 0 & (max+f).x = 0 & (max-f).x = 0 by A2,FUNCT_1:def 2;
     hence f.x <= (max+f).x & f.x >= -(max-f).x;
    end;
end;

Lm1:
for X be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL, r be Real holds
 (r > 0 implies less_dom(f,r) = less_dom(max+f,r)) &
 (r <= 0 implies less_dom(f,r) = great_dom(max-f,-r))
proof
    let X be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL, r be Real;
    hereby assume A1: r > 0;
     reconsider r1 = r as ExtReal;
     now let x be Element of X;
      assume x in less_dom(max+f,r); then
A2:   x in dom(max+f) & (max+f).x < r by MESFUNC1:def 11; then
A3:   x in dom f by MESFUNC2:def 2;
      max(f.x,0) < r1 by A2,MESFUNC2:def 2; then

A6:   x in dom(max+f) by MESFUNC2:def 2; then
      (max+f).x = max(f.x,0) by MESFUNC2:def 2; then
      (max+f).x < r by A1,A5,XXREAL_0:29;
      hence x in less_dom(max+f,r) by A6,MESFUNC1:def 11;
     end; then
     less_dom(f,r) c= less_dom(max+f,r);
     hence less_dom(max+f,r) = less_dom(f,r) by A4;
    end;
    assume A7: r <= 0;
    reconsider r1 = r as ExtReal;
    now let x be Element of X;
     assume x in great_dom(max-f,-r); then
A8:  x in dom(max-f) & (max-f).x > -r by MESFUNC1:def 13; then
A9:  x in dom f by MESFUNC2:def 3;
A10: max(-(f.x),0) > -r1 by A8,MESFUNC2:def 3;
     now assume 0 > -(f.x); then
      max(-(f.x),0) = 0 by XXREAL_0:def 10;
      hence contradiction by A7,A10;
     end; then
     max(-(f.x),0) = -(f.x) by XXREAL_0:def 10; then
     f.x < r1 by A10,XXREAL_3:38;
     hence x in less_dom(f,r) by A9,MESFUNC1:def 11;
    end; then

    now let x be Element of X;
     assume x in less_dom(f,r); then
A12: x in dom f & f.x < r by MESFUNC1:def 11; then
A13: x in dom(max-f) by MESFUNC2:def 3;
     max(-(f.x),0) = -(f.x) by A7,A12,XXREAL_0:def 10; then
     (max-f).x = -(f.x) by A13,MESFUNC2:def 3; then
     (max-f).x > -r1 by A12,XXREAL_3:38;
     hence x in great_dom(max-f,-r) by A13,MESFUNC1:def 13;
    end; then
    less_dom(f,r) c= great_dom(max-f,-r);
    hence great_dom(max-f,-r) = less_dom(f,r) by A11;

proof
   let X be non empty set, S be SigmaField of X, f be PartFunc of X,ExtREAL,
   A be Element of S;
   assume A1: A c= dom f;
   hence f is A-measurable implies

   assume A2: max+f is A-measurable & max-f is A-measurable;
A3:dom (max-f) = dom f by MESFUNC2:def 3;
   now let r be Real;
    per cases;
    suppose r > 0; then
     less_dom(f,r) = less_dom(max+f,r) by Lm1;
     hence A /\ less_dom(f,r) in S by A2,MESFUNC1:def 16;
    end;
    suppose r <= 0; then
     less_dom(f,r) = great_dom(max-f,-r) by Lm1;

     Integral(M,G.n) = - Integral(M,F.n)
       by A21,A4,Th52; then
     J.n = - Integral(M,F.n) by A19; then
     I.n = -(-Integral(M,F.n)) by A20,MESFUNC1:def 7;
     hence I.n = Integral(M,F.n);
    end;
    thus I is convergent by A19,DBLSEQ_3:17;
A23:lim I = - Integral(M,lim G) by A19,DBLSEQ_3:17;
A24:E = dom(lim F) by A1,MESFUNC8:def 9; then
A25:dom(-(lim F)) = E by MESFUNC1:def 7; then
A26:dom(lim G) = dom(-(lim F)) by A8,MESFUNC8:def 9;
    for x be Element of X st x in dom(lim G) holds (lim G).x = (-(lim F)).x
    proof
     let x be Element of X;
     assume A27: x in dom(lim G); then
A30: (lim G).x = lim(G#x) by MESFUNC8:def 9;
A28: F#x is convergent by A27,A26,A25,A6;
     G#x = -(F#x) by Th38; then
A29: lim(G#x) = - lim(F#x) by A28,DBLSEQ_3:17;
     lim(F#x) = (lim F).x by A27,A26,A25,A24,MESFUNC8:def 9;
     hence (lim G).x = (-(lim F)).x by A29,A30,A27,A26,MESFUNC1:def 7;
    end; then
    lim G = -(lim F) by A26,PARTFUN1:5; then
    Integral(M,lim G) = - Integral(M,lim F)
      by A1,A3,A4,A6,A24,Th52,MESFUNC8:25;
    hence Integral(M,lim F) = lim I by A23;
end;

    M |=0 'G' prop i by A2,A1;then
    (SAT M).[0+1,prop i] =1 by LTLAXIO1:10;
    hence contradiction by LTLAXIO1:9,A1;
  end;
end;

theorem
  for F be finite Subset of LTLB_WFF holds (F |-0 'G' A implies F |- A)
proof
  let F be finite Subset of LTLB_WFF;
  assume F |-0 'G' A; then
  F |=0 'G' A by th266;
  hence F |- A by LTLAXIO4:33,th21;
end;

::#INSERT: The converse of the above theorem does not hold
theorem
  {prop i} |- prop i & not {prop i} |-0 'G' prop i
proof
  prop i in {prop i} by TARSKI:def 1;
  hence {prop i} |- prop i by LTLAXIO1:42;
  thus not {prop i} |-0 'G' prop i by th266,th21cp;
end;

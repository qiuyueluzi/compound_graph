begin :: Tarski Axioms

:: Here are readable Mizar proofs of some axiomatic geometry theorems due
:: to the great Polish mathematician Alfred Tarski (born Teitelbaum), and
:: we hope to continue this work. The first author ported the code to
:: HOL Light (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/), which can be
:: found in any recent subversion of HOL Light as
:: hol_light/RichterHilbertAxiomGeometry/TarskiAxiomGeometry_read.ml

:: This is largely a Mizar port of Julien Narboux's Coq pseudo-code
:: http://dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr/~narboux/tarski.html.  We partially
:: prove the theorem of the 1983 book Metamathematische Methoden in
:: der Geometrie by Schwabh\"auser, Szmielew, and Tarski, that Tarski's
:: (extremely weak!) plane geometry axioms imply Hilbert's axioms.  We
:: get about as far as Narboux, with Gupta's amazing proof which
:: implies Hilbert's axiom I1 that two points determine a line.

:: Tarski's axioms are easy to find, but the first Tarski proofs we
:: ever learned were on wikiproofs's port of Narboux's results
:: http://www.wikiproofs.de/w/index.php?title=Interface:Tarski%27s_geometry_axioms
:: Our Mizar proofs are much more readable than either Narboux's Coq
:: pseudo-code or wikiproof's JHilbert code.

:: Our Mizar coding was heavily influenced by Wojciech A. Trybulec's
:: incsp_1.miz in the MML library on axioms of incidence geometry.

:: S will be a Tarski plane, a set of points which is a model of the
:: first 7 of Tarski's Geometry axioms A1--A7.  There are two binary
:: relations (predicates) defined on S, between and â‰¡, for
:: betweenness of points and equidistance of segments.

:: We carry the axioms A1--A7 around as part of the statements of the
:: theorems. To avoid this minor clutter one has to define a Mizar type of
:: planes satisfying axioms A1--A7, as Trybulec does with by
:: `mode IncSpace is IncSpace-like IncStruct;'
:: In Mizar it isn't possible to define such a type (or model) without
:: proving that some model exists.  Trybulec's existence proofs runs
:: over 450 lines.  So we define a predicate `S Tarski-model' which
:: means that the plane S satisfies the axioms A1--A7, and then prove
:: trivial theorems A1--A7 which say that if S Tarski-model, then S
:: satisfies an axiom A1--A7.  The extra clutter involving the
:: predicate Tarski-model, and the label TarskiModel which stands for
:: the statement `S Tarski-model' could be avoided by loading all our
:: results into one gigantic theorem.  Our approach seems preferable.

:: Our axioms have descriptive names, largely the names Narboux used,
:: CongruenceSymmetry (A1), CongruenceEquivalenceRelation (A2),
:: CongruenceIdentity (A3), SegmentConstruction (A4), SAS (A5),
:: BetweennessIdentity (A6), and Pasch (A7).

:: Our theorems are EquivReflexive, EquivSymmetric, EquivTransitive,
:: Baaa, Bqaa, C1 (for Hilbert's axiom C1), Bsymmetry, Baaq,
:: BEquality, B124and234then123, BTransitivity, BTransitivityOrdered,
:: B124and234Ordered, B124and234Ordered, SegmentAddition,
:: CongruenceDoubleSymmetry, C1prime, SegmentSubtraction,
:: EasyAngleTransport, B123and134Ordered, BextendToLine, GuptaEasy,
:: Inner5Segments, RhombusDiagBisect, FlatNormal,
:: EqDist2PointsBetween, EqDist2PointsInnerBetween, Gupta, I1part1,
:: I1part2, LineEqRefl, LineEqA1, LineEqSymmetric, LineEqTrans,
:: onlineEq, I1part2Reverse, and I1.

  st for n be Nat st N <=n holds r < n /log(2,n)
  proof

    proof
      per cases;
      suppose A1:0 < r0;

    proof
      let n be Nat;
      assume N<=n; then
      2 to_power k <= n/log(2,n) by A2; then

      E1:x to_power k < 2 to_power x by P1;
      0 < x to_power k by POWER:34,AS;
      hence 1/ (2 to_power x) < 1/ (x to_power k)

    proof
      let x,y be Element of S;

    thus S is right_zeroed
    proof let x be Element of S;
      reconsider x1=x as Element of RAlgebra NAT

    proof
      let x,y be Element of S;

    thus S is right_unital
    proof
      let x be Element of S;
      reconsider x1=x as Element of RAlgebra NAT by LM12;

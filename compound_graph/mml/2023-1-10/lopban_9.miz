  existence
  proof
    defpred P[object] means $1 is BilinearOperator of X,Y,Z;

    take IT;
    for x be object st x in IT holds x in Funcs(the carrier of [:X,Y:],
     the carrier of Z) by A1;
    hence IT is Subset of RealVectSpace(the carrier of [:X,Y:],
      Z) by TARSKI:def 3;
    let x be set;
    thus x in IT implies x is BilinearOperator of X,Y,Z by A1;
    assume

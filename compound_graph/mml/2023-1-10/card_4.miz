  f,g for Function;

theorem
  X is finite implies X is countable;

theorem

reserve r for Real;

theorem Th3:
  r <> 0 or n = 0 iff r|^n <> 0
proof
  defpred P[Nat] means r <> 0 or $1 = 0 iff r|^$1 <> 0;
A1: P[k] implies P[k+1]
  proof
A2: r|^(k+1) = r|^k*r by NEWTON:6;

  hence thesis;
end;

Lm1: (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1) implies n1 <= n2
proof
  assume
A1: (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1);
  assume
A2: n1 > n2;
  then consider n being Nat such that
A3: n1 = n2+n by NAT_1:10;
  n <> 0 by A2,A3;
  then consider k being Nat such that
A4: n = k+1 by NAT_1:6;
A5: 2|^n2 <> 0 by Th3;
  reconsider k as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 12;
  2|^n1 = (2|^n2)*(2|^(k+1)) by A3,A4,NEWTON:8;
  then (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = 2|^n2*(2|^(k+1)*(2*m1+1));
  then 2|^(k+1)*(2*m1+1) = 2*m2+1 by A1,A5,XCMPLX_1:5;
  then 2*m2+1 = 2|^k*(2|^1)*(2*m1+1) by NEWTON:8
    .= 2*(2|^k)*(2*m1+1)
    .= 2*((2|^k)*(2*m1+1));
  then
A6: 2 divides 2*m2+1 by NAT_D:def 3;
  2 divides 2*m2 by NAT_D:def 3;
  hence contradiction by A6,NAT_D:7,10;
end;

theorem Th4:
  (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1) implies n1 = n2 & m1 = m2
proof
A1: 2|^n1 <> 0 by Th3;
  assume
A2: (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1);
  then n1 <= n2 & n2 <= n1 by Lm1;
  hence n1 = n2 by XXREAL_0:1;
  then 2*m1+1 = 2*m2+1 by A2,A1,XCMPLX_1:5;
  hence thesis;
end;

Lm2: x in [:NAT,NAT:] implies ex n1,n2 being Element of NAT st x = [n1,n2]

  end;
  dom f = [:NAT,NAT:] & rng f c= NAT by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  then card [:NAT,NAT:] c= card NAT by A3,CARD_1:10;

  hence thesis by CARD_1:5;
end;

theorem Th6:
  (omega)*`(omega) = omega by Th5,CARD_2:def 2;

theorem Th7:
  X is countable & Y is countable implies [:X,Y:] is countable
proof
  assume card X c= omega & card Y c= omega;
  then [:card X,card Y:] c= [:omega,omega:] by ZFMISC_1:96;
  then card [:card X,card Y:] c= card [:omega,omega:] by CARD_1:11;
  then card [:card X,card Y:] c= (omega)*`omega by CARD_2:def 2;

    proof
      let x be object;

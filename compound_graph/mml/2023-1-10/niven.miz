theorem Th1:
  for a,b,c,d being Complex st b <> 0 & a/b = c/d holds a = b*c/d
  proof
    let a,b,c,d be Complex;
    assume that
A1: b <> 0 and
A2: a/b = c/d;
    thus a = b*(a/b) by A1,XCMPLX_1:87
    .= b*c/d by A2,XCMPLX_1:74;
  end;

theorem Th2:
  for a,b being Real st |.a.| = b holds a = b or a = -b
  proof
    let a be Real;
    |.a.| = a or |.a.| = -a by COMPLEX1:71;
    hence thesis;
  end;

theorem Th3:
  |.i.| <= 2 implies i = -2 or i = -1 or i = 0 or i = 1 or i = 2
  proof
    assume |.i.| <= 2;
    then |.i.| = 0 or ... or |.i.| = 2;
    hence thesis by ABSVALUE:2,Th2;
  end;

theorem Th4:
  n <> 0 implies i divides i |^ n
proof
  assume n <> 0;
  then consider b being Nat such that
A1: n = b+1 by NAT_1:6;
  reconsider b as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 12;
  i |^ 1 divides i |^ (b+1) by NAT_1:12,NEWTON03:16;
  hence thesis by A1;

theorem Th16:
  t > 0 implies ex i st t*i <= r <= t*(i+1)
  proof

    proof
      take i1=[\r/t/];
      i1 <= r/t by INT_1:def 6;
      then i1*t <= r/t*t by A0,XREAL_1:64;
      then t*i1 <= r/(t/t) by XCMPLX_1:82;
      hence t*i1 <= r by A0,XCMPLX_1:51;
    end;
    set F=[/r/t\];
    f: for i1 being Integer st P[i1] holds i1 <= F
    proof
      let i1 be Integer;
      assume P[i1];
      then i1*t/t <= r/t by A0,XREAL_1:72;
      then i1*(t/t) <= r/t;
      then i1*1 <= r/t & r/t <= [/r/t\] by A0,XCMPLX_1:60,INT_1:def 7;
      hence i1 <= F by XXREAL_0:2;
    end;
    consider i such that
    i: P[i] & for i1 being Integer st P[i1] holds i1<=i from INT_1:sch 6(f,g);
    take i;
    thus t*i <= r by i;
    i+1 > i+0 by XREAL_1:6;
    hence r <= t*(i+1) by i;

::$N Niven's Theorem
theorem
  r/PI is rational & sin r is rational implies sin r in {0, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2}
  proof
    consider i such that
A0: 2*PI*i <= r <= 2*PI*(i+1) by Th16;
    set a = 2*PI*i;
    set R = r-a;
A2: a-a <= R <= 2*PI+a-a by A0,XREAL_1:9;
    assume
A3: r/PI is rational & sin r is rational;
    a/PI = (2*i*PI)/PI
    .= 2*i by XCMPLX_1:89; then
A4: R/PI = r/PI-2*i;
    R = 2*PI*(-i)+r;
    then sin r = sin R by COMPLEX2:8;
    hence thesis by A2,A3,A4,Lm5;

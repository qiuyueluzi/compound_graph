Lm1: for g,r,r1 be Real holds 0<g & r<=r1 implies r-g<r1 & r<r1+g
proof
  let g,r,r1 be Real;
  assume that
A1: 0<g and
A2: r<=r1;
  r-g<r1-0 by A1,A2,XREAL_1:15;
  hence r-g<r1;
  r+0<r1+g by A1,A2,XREAL_1:8;
  hence thesis;
end;

Lm2: for X be set st rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2)\X holds rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2) &
dom(f1(#)f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 & rng seq c=dom f1 & rng seq c=dom f2 & rng seq c=
dom f1\X & rng seq c=dom f2\X
proof
  let X be set;
  assume
A1: rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2)\X;
  hence
A2: rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2) by XBOOLE_1:1;
  thus
A3: dom(f1(#)f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 by VALUED_1:def 4;
  then
A4: dom(f1(#)f2)c=dom f2 by XBOOLE_1:17;
  dom(f1(#)f2)c=dom f1 by A3,XBOOLE_1:17;
  hence rng seq c=dom f1 & rng seq c=dom f2 by A2,A4;

Lm4: for X be set st rng seq c=dom(f1+f2)\X holds rng seq c=dom(f1+f2) & dom(
f1+f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 & rng seq c=dom f1 & rng seq c=dom f2 & rng seq c=dom f1\
X & rng seq c=dom f2\X
proof
  let X be set;
  assume
A1: rng seq c=dom(f1+f2)\X;
  hence
A2: rng seq c=dom(f1+f2) by XBOOLE_1:1;
  thus
A3: dom(f1+f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 by VALUED_1:def 1;
  then
A4: dom(f1+f2)c=dom f2 by XBOOLE_1:17;
  dom(f1+f2)c=dom f1 by A3,XBOOLE_1:17;

theorem Th2:

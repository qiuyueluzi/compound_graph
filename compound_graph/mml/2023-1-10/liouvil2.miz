  proof
    let L be Liouville;
    assume L is algebraic;
    then consider f being non-zero INT -valued Polynomial of FC such that
A1: In(L,FC) is_a_root_of f by Th26;
    reconsider g = f as non-zero INT -valued Polynomial of FR by Th4,Th13,Th22;
    L is irrational Element of FR by XREAL_0:def 1;
    then ex A being positive Real st
    for p being Integer, q being positive Nat holds
    |. L-p/q .| > A/(q|^len g) by A1,Th4,Th18,Th28;
    hence thesis by Lm4;

proof
  assume that

  consider d such that
A1: for n holds d.n = F(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
  set b = seq_const x0;
  assume
A2: for n holds a.n = x0 - p/(n+1);
  now

end;

theorem Th6:
  for x0 be Real holds (for n holds a.n = x0 + p/(n+1))

A1: for n holds d.n = F(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
  set b = seq_const x0;
  assume
A2: for n holds a.n = x0 + p/(n+1);
  now
    let n be Element of NAT;

      .= x0 + d.n by SEQ_1:57
      .= x0 + p/(n+1) by A1
      .=a.n by A2;

A9: Nn c= dom f
    proof
      let x be object;

    then consider g such that

     reconsider g as Element of REAL by XREAL_0:def 1;
    take g;
    ex g1 st g1 = g & x0 - p/(n+1) < g1 & g1 <x0 + p/(n+1) by A15;
    hence x0 - p/(n+1) < g & g <x0 + p/(n+1);
    thus f.g = r by A16;
    thus thesis by A9,A15;
  end;
  consider d such that
A17: for n being Element of NAT holds P[n,d.n] from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A7);
A18: rng d c= dom f
  proof
    let x be object;

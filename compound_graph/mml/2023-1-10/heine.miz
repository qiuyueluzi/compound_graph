reserve a,b,x,y for Real,

reserve p,w for Real;

theorem Th1:
  for A being SubSpace of RealSpace, p,q being Point of A st x = p
  & y = q holds dist(p,q) = |.x-y.|
proof
  let A be SubSpace of RealSpace, p,q be Point of A;
  assume
A1: x = p & y = q;
  thus dist(p,q) = (the distance of A).(p,q) by METRIC_1:def 1
    .= (real_dist).(x, y) by A1,METRIC_1:def 13,TOPMETR:def 1
    .= |.x-y.| by METRIC_1:def 12;
end;

reserve seq for Real_Sequence;

theorem Th2:
  seq is increasing & rng seq c= NAT implies n <= seq.n
proof
  defpred P[Nat] means $1 <= seq.$1;
  assume that
A1: seq is increasing and
A2: rng seq c= NAT;
A3: for k st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof

    k+1 in NAT;
    then k+1 in dom seq by FUNCT_2:def 1;
    then seq.(k+1) in rng seq by FUNCT_1:def 3;
    then reconsider k9 = seq.(k+1) as Element of NAT by A2;
    seq.k < seq.(k+1) by A1,SEQM_3:def 6;
    then k < k9 by A4,XXREAL_0:2;
    hence thesis by NAT_1:13;
  end;
  0 in NAT;
  then 0 in dom seq by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  then seq.0 in rng seq by FUNCT_1:def 3;
  then

  :Def1:
  for n holds it.n = k to_power (seq.n);
  existence
  proof
    deffunc F(Nat) = k to_power (seq.$1);
    thus ex s being Real_Sequence st
   for n holds s.n = F(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
  end;
  uniqueness
  proof
    let s1,s2 be Real_Sequence;
    assume that
A1: for n holds s1.n = k to_power (seq.n) and
A2: for n holds s2.n = k to_power (seq.n);
    let n be Element of NAT;
    thus s1.n = k to_power (seq.n) by A1
    .= s2.n by A2;
  end;
end;

theorem Th3:
  seq is divergent_to+infty implies 2 to_power seq is divergent_to+infty
proof
  assume
A1: seq is divergent_to+infty;
  let r be Real;
  consider p being Nat such that
A2: p > r by SEQ_4:3;
  consider n such that
A3: for m st n <= m holds p < seq.m by A1;
  take n;
  let m;
  assume m >= n;
  then p < seq.m by A3;
  then
A4: 2 to_power p < 2 to_power (seq.m) by POWER:39;
  p < 2 to_power p by NEWTON:86;
  then p < 2 to_power (seq.m) by A4,XXREAL_0:2;
  then r < 2 to_power (seq.m) by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
  hence thesis by Def1;

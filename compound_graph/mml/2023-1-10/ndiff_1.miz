A5: 0<g;
    set N={y where y is Point of S:||.y-r.|| < g};
    N is Neighbourhood of r by A5,NFCONT_1:3;

    consider s be Point of S such that
A8: x=s and
A9: ||.s-r.|| <g by A6;
    take s;
    thus s in N by A9;

  end;
A10: for n ex s be Point of S st P[n,s]
  proof
    let n;
    0 < 1 * (n + 1)";
    then 0 < 1/(n + 1) by XCMPLX_0:def 9;

    take n;
    let m be Nat;
A19:  m in NAT by ORDINAL1:def 12;

    1/(m+1) <= 1/(n+1) by A20,XREAL_1:118;
    then ||.s1.m - r.|| < 1/(n+1) by A21,XXREAL_0:2;
    hence ||.s1.m - r.|| <p by A18,XXREAL_0:2;
  end;
  then
A22: s1 is convergent;
  then lim s1 = r by A15,NORMSP_1:def 7;
  then r in X` by A22,A12,A1;
  hence contradiction by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

theorem

  then
A10: s1.n in rng s1 by FUNCT_1:def 3;
  ||.s1.n - (lim s1).|| <g by A9;
  then s1.n in {y where y is Point of S:||.y-(lim s1).|| < g};

    f/.x0 - f/.x0 = L.(x0-x0) + R/.(x0-x0) by A3,NFCONT_1:4;
    then 0.T = L.(x0-x0) + R/.(x0-x0) by RLVECT_1:15;
    then 0.T = L.0.S + R/.(x0-x0) by RLVECT_1:15;
    then
A4: 0.T = L.0.S + R/.0.S by RLVECT_1:15;
    L.(0.S) =modetrans(L,S,T).(0.S) by LOPBAN_1:def 11
      .= modetrans(L,S,T).(0*0.S) by RLVECT_1:10
      .=0*modetrans(L,S,T).0.S by LOPBAN_1:def 5
      .=0.T by RLVECT_1:10;
    hence
A5: R/.0.S=0.T by A4,RLVECT_1:4;
A6: now
      let s1 be sequence of S;
      assume that
      rng s1 c= dom R and
A7:   s1 is convergent & lim s1 = 0.S and
A8:   for n being Nat holds s1.n<>0.S;
      A9: s1 is (0.S)-convergent sequence of S by A7,Def4;
      s1 is non-zero by A8,Th7;
      hence R/*s1 is convergent & lim (R/*s1)=R/.(0.S) by A5,A9,Th24;
    end;
    R is total by Def5;
    then dom R=the carrier of S by PARTFUN1:def 2;
    hence thesis by A3,A6,Th27;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1;

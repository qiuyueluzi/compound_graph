theorem Th3:
:: Baire category theorem - Banach space version
  for X be RealBanachSpace, Y be SetSequence of X st union rng Y =
the carrier of X & (for n be Nat holds Y.n is closed)
 ex n0 be Nat, r be Real, x0 be Point of X
    st 0 < r & Ball (x0,r) c= Y.n0
proof
  let X be RealBanachSpace, Y be SetSequence of X;
  assume that
A1: union rng Y = the carrier of X and
A2: for n be Nat holds Y.n is closed;
  now
    let n be Nat;
    reconsider Yn = Y.n as Subset of TopSpaceNorm X;
    Y.n is closed by A2;
    then Yn is closed by NORMSP_2:15;

holds f is_Lipschitzian_on the carrier of X & f is_continuous_on the carrier of

proof
  let X,Y be RealNormSpace, f be Lipschitzian LinearOperator of X,Y;
  consider K being Real such that

A3: now

    f/.x -f/.y =f.x +(-1)* f.y by RLVECT_1:16;

    ||.f/.x -f/.y .||<=K*||. x-y .||+||. x-y .|| by A2,A4,XREAL_1:38;
    hence ||. f/.x -f/.y .|| <= (K+1) * ||. x-y .||;
  end;
  dom f =the carrier of X by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  hence f is_Lipschitzian_on the carrier of X by A1,A3,NFCONT_1:def 9;
  hence
A5: f is_continuous_on the carrier of X by NFCONT_1:45;
  hereby
    let x be Point of X;
    f|(the carrier of X) = f by RELSET_1:19;
    hence f is_continuous_in x by A5,NFCONT_1:def 7;

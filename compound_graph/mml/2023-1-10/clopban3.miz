  let m be Nat;
  defpred P[Nat] means seq.$1 = (Partial_Sums seq).$1;
A2: for k be Nat st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof
    let k be Nat such that
A3: P[k];
    thus seq.(k+1) = 0.X + seq.(k+1) by RLVECT_1:4
      .= (Partial_Sums seq).k + seq.(k+1) by A1,A3
      .= (Partial_Sums seq).(k+1) by BHSP_4:def 1;

A4: P[0] by BHSP_4:def 1;
  for n be Nat holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 2(A4,A2);
  then for n be Element of NAT holds P[n];
  then seq = Partial_Sums seq by FUNCT_2:63;
  hence thesis by A1;

    m be Nat holds 0 <= ||.seq.||.m
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq be sequence of X;
  let m be Nat;
  ||.seq.||.m = ||.seq.m.|| by NORMSP_0:def 4;

theorem Th3:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, x,y,z be Element of X holds ||.x-y.||
  = ||.(x-z)+(z-y).||
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let x,y,z be Element of X;
  thus ||.x-y.|| = ||.x-0.X-y.|| by RLVECT_1:13

theorem Th4:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, seq be sequence of X holds seq is
  convergent implies
  for s be Real st 0 < s ex n be Nat st for m be
  Nat st n<=m holds ||.seq.m -seq.n.||<s
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq be sequence of X;
  assume seq is convergent;
  then consider g1 be Element of X such that
A1: for s be Real st 0<s ex n be Nat st
    for m be Nat st n<=m holds ||.seq.m -g1.||<s;
  let s be Real;

  then consider n be Nat such that
A2: for m be Nat st n<=m holds ||.seq.m -g1.||<s/2 by A1;
  now
    let m be Nat;
    assume n<=m;
    then

    then ||.seq.m -g1.||+||.g1-seq.n.||<s/2+s/2 by A3,XREAL_1:8;
    hence ||.seq.m -seq.n.|| < s by A4,XXREAL_0:2;

theorem Th5:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, seq be sequence of X holds seq is
Cauchy_sequence_by_Norm iff
 for p be Real st p > 0 holds ex n be Nat
  st for m be Nat st n <= m holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< p
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq be sequence of X;
A1: now
    assume
A2: for p be Real st p > 0 holds ex n be Nat st for m be
    Nat st n <= m holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< p;
    now
      let s be Real;
      assume 0<s;
      then consider k be Nat such that
A3:   for m be Nat st k<=m holds ||.seq.m -seq.k.||<s/2 by A2;
      now
        let m,n be Nat such that

A5:     k<=n;
        ||.seq.n -seq.k.||<s/2 by A3,A5;

        ||.seq.m -seq.k.||<s/2 by A3,A4;
        then
A7:     ||.seq.m -seq.k.||+||.seq.k-seq.n.||<s/2+s/2 by A6,XREAL_1:8;
        ||.seq.m -seq.k+(seq.k-seq.n).|| <=||.seq.m -seq.k.||+||.seq.k-
seq.n.|| & ||.seq.m -seq.k+(seq.k-seq.n).|| =||.seq.m -seq.n.|| by Th3,
CLVECT_1:def 13;
        hence ||.seq.m -seq.n.|| < s by A7,XXREAL_0:2;
      end;
      hence ex k be Nat st for m,n be Nat st k <= m & k
      <=n holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< s;
    end;
    hence seq is Cauchy_sequence_by_Norm by CSSPACE3:8;
  end;
  now
    assume
A8: seq is Cauchy_sequence_by_Norm;
    thus for p be Real st p > 0 holds ex n be Nat st for m be
    Nat st n <= m holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< p
    proof
      let p be Real;
      assume p >0;

A2: for k be Nat st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof
    let k be Nat such that
A3: P[k];
    thus ||.seq.||.(k+1) =0 + ||.seq.||.(k+1)
      .= ||.0.X.|| + ||.seq.||.(k+1)
      .= ||.seq.k.|| + ||.seq.||.(k+1) by A1

      .= (Partial_Sums ||.seq.||).(k+1) by SERIES_1:def 1;
  end;
A4: P[0] by SERIES_1:def 1;
  for n be Nat holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 2(A4,A2);
  hence (Partial_Sums ||.seq.||).m = ||.seq.||.m
    .= ||.seq.m.|| by NORMSP_0:def 4
    .= ||.0.X.|| by A1
    .= 0;
end;

theorem Th7:

  is subsequence of seq & seq is convergent implies seq1 is convergent
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq,seq1 be sequence of X;

   for m be Nat st n<=m holds ||.(seq.m)-g1.||< p by A2;
  take g1;
  let p be Real;
  assume 0<p;
  then consider n1 be Nat such that
A4: for m be Nat st n1<=m holds ||.(seq.m)-g1.||<p by A3;
  take n=n1;
  let m be Nat such that
A5: n<=m;

  consider Nseq be increasing sequence of NAT such that
A7: seq1=seq*Nseq by A1,VALUED_0:def 17;
  m<=Nseq.m by SEQM_3:14;
  then
A8: n<=Nseq.m by A5,XXREAL_0:2;
  seq1.m=seq.(Nseq.m) by A7,FUNCT_2:15,A6;
  hence thesis by A4,A8;
end;

theorem Th8:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, seq,seq1 be sequence of X holds seq1
  is subsequence of seq & seq is convergent implies lim seq1=lim seq
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq,seq1 be sequence of X;

A1: seq1 is subsequence of seq and
A2: seq is convergent;
  consider Nseq be increasing sequence of NAT such that
A3: seq1=seq*Nseq by A1,VALUED_0:def 17;
A4: now

    by A2,CLVECT_1:def 16;
    take n=n1;
    let m be Nat such that
A6: n<=m;
A7: m in NAT by ORDINAL1:def 12;
    m<=Nseq.m by SEQM_3:14;
    then
A8: n<=Nseq.m by A6,XXREAL_0:2;
    seq1.m=seq.(Nseq.m) by A3,FUNCT_2:15,A7;

  seq1 is convergent by A1,A2,Th7;

   thus

  x) by CFUNCDOM:def 9,CLVECT_1:def 2,def 3,def 4;

  x*0.X =x*(0.X+0.X) by RLVECT_1:def 4

  then 0.X = x*0.X + x*0.X-x* 0.X by RLVECT_1:15;
  then 0.X = x*0.X + (x*0.X-x* 0.X) by RLVECT_1:def 3;

  0.X*x =(0.X+0.X)*x by RLVECT_1:def 4

    .=y*x-z*x by A3,RLVECT_1:def 3;
  thus x+y-z = x+(y-z) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
  thus x-y+z = x-(y-z) by RLVECT_1:29;
  thus x-y-z = x-(y+z) by RLVECT_1:27;

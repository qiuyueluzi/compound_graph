proof
  let A,B being FinSequence, f being Function;
  assume
A1: rng A \/ rng B c= dom f;
  then
A2: rng (A^B) c= dom f by FINSEQ_1:31;
  then reconsider fAB = f*(A^B) as FinSequence by FINSEQ_1:16;
A3: rng B c= rng A \/ rng B by XBOOLE_1:7;
  then reconsider fB = f*B as FinSequence by A1,FINSEQ_1:16,XBOOLE_1:1;
A4: dom (f*B) = dom B by A1,A3,RELAT_1:27,XBOOLE_1:1;
  then
A5: len fB = len B by FINSEQ_3:29;
A6: rng A c= rng A \/ rng B by XBOOLE_1:7;
  then reconsider fA = f*A as FinSequence by A1,FINSEQ_1:16,XBOOLE_1:1;
  take fA, fB;

A8: dom (f*A) = dom A by A1,A6,RELAT_1:27,XBOOLE_1:1;
  then
A9: len fA = len A by FINSEQ_3:29;
A10: now
    let k be Nat;
    assume 1 <=k & k <= len fAB;
    then
A11: k in dom fAB by FINSEQ_3:25;
    per cases;
    suppose
A12:  k in dom fA;
      hence (fA^fB).k = fA.k by FINSEQ_1:def 7

        .= f.((A^B).k) by A8,A12,FINSEQ_1:def 7
        .= fAB.k by A11,FUNCT_1:12;
    end;
    suppose
      not k in dom fA;
      then consider n being Nat such that
A13:  n in dom B and
A14:  k=len A + n by A8,A7,A11,FINSEQ_1:25;
      thus fAB.k = f.((A^B).k) by A11,FUNCT_1:12
        .= f.(B.n) by A13,A14,FINSEQ_1:def 7

    .=<* {},{} *>by A1,PRE_POLY:71;
  len decomp b = 1 by A2,A3,FINSEQ_3:29;

  for i,j being Nat, b being bag of j st i <= j holds (b
  |i) is Element of Bags i
proof
  let i,j being Nat, b being bag of j;
  assume
A1: i <= j;
  Segm i c= Segm j
  proof
    let x be object;
    assume x in Segm i;
    then x in {y where y is Nat : y < i } by AXIOMS:4;
    then consider x9 being Nat such that
A2: x9=x and
A3: x9 < i;
    x9 < j by A1,A3,XXREAL_0:2;
    then x9 in {y where y is Nat : y < j };

  st b19 = (b1|i) & b29 = (b2|i) & b1 divides b2 holds b19 divides b29
proof
  let i,j be set, b1,b2 be bag of j, b19,b29 be bag of i;
  assume that
A1: b19=(b1|i) & b29=(b2|i) and
A2: b1 divides b2;

    per cases;
    suppose

      then b19.k = {} by FUNCT_1:def 2
        .= b29.k by A3,A4,FUNCT_1:def 2;
      hence b19.k <= b29.k;

    suppose
      k in dom b19;
      then b19.k = b1.k & b29.k = b2.k by A1,A3,FUNCT_1:47;

  b19=(b1|i) & b29=(b2|i) holds (b1-' b2)|i = b19-' b29 & (b1+b2)|i = b19+b29
proof
  let i,j be set, b1, b2 being bag of j, b19, b29 being bag of i;
  assume that
A1: b19=(b1|i) and
A2: b29=(b2|i);
  dom b1 = j by PARTFUN1:def 2;
  then
A3: dom (b1|i) = j /\ i by RELAT_1:61;
  dom b2 = j by PARTFUN1:def 2;
  then
A4: dom (b2|i) = j /\ i by RELAT_1:61;
  dom (b1 + b2) = j by PARTFUN1:def 2;

A6: now
    let x be object;

A9: now
    let x be object;

      .= Segm(n+1) by AFINSQ_1:2;
    then b1 is ManySortedSet of n+1 by PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;

    end;
    hence b1|n = b by A3,A1,FUNCT_1:2;

    then
A7: n in dom (n .--> k);
    then n in dom b \/ dom (n .--> k) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;

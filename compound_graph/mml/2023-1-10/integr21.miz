reserve Z for RealNormSpace;
reserve a,b,c,d,e,r for Real;
reserve A,B for non empty closed_interval Subset of REAL;

Lm2:
  a <= b & c in ['a,b'] & d in ['a,b']
  implies ['min(c,d),max(c,d)'] c= ['a,b']
  proof
    assume A1:a<=b & c in ['a,b'] & d in ['a,b'];
    then ['a,b'] = [.a,b.] by INTEGRA5:def 3;
    then
A2: a <=c & d <=b & a <=d & c <= b by A1,XXREAL_1:1;
    per cases;
    suppose A3:c <= d; then
A4:   c = min(c,d) & d = max(c,d) by XXREAL_0:def 9,def 10;
      ['c,b'] c= ['a,b'] & ['c,d'] c= ['c,b'] by A2,A3,INTEGR19:1;
      hence ['min(c,d),max(c,d)'] c=['a,b'] by A4;
    end;
    suppose A6:not c <= d; then
A7:   d = min(c,d) & c = max(c,d) by XXREAL_0:def 9,def 10;
      ['d,b'] c= ['a,b'] & ['d,c'] c= ['d,b'] by A2,A6,INTEGR19:1;
      hence ['min(c,d),max(c,d)'] c=['a,b'] by A7;
    end;
  end;

Lm3:
  for X,Y,Z be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,Y

  proof
    let X,Y,Z be non empty set, f be PartFunc of X,Y;
    rng f c= Y; then
    f is Function of dom f,Y by FUNCT_2:2;
    hence thesis by FUNCT_2:32;

theorem Th1915:
  for f be PartFunc of REAL,the carrier of Z st
    f is bounded & A c= dom f holds f|A is bounded
proof

  consider r be Real such that
A3: for x be set st x in dom f holds ||. f/.x .|| <r by A1;
  now let x be set;
    assume x in dom(f|A); then
    ||. f/.x .|| <r & x in dom f /\ A by A3,A2,RELAT_1:61;
    hence ||. (f|A)/.x .|| <r by PARTFUN2:16;
  end;
  hence f|A is bounded;

theorem Th1915a:
  for f be PartFunc of REAL,the carrier of Z
    st f|A is bounded & B c= A & B c= dom (f|A)
      holds f|B is bounded
proof
  let f be PartFunc of REAL,the carrier of Z;
  assume
A1: f|A is bounded & B c= A & B c= dom (f|A);
  set g = f|A;
A4: g|B is bounded by Th1915,A1;
  consider r be Real such that
A5: for x be set st x in dom (g|B) holds ||. (g|B)/.x .|| <r by A4;
  g|B = f|B by A1,RELAT_1:74;

    st a <= c & c <= d & d <= b & f| ['a,b'] is bounded & ['a,b'] c= dom f

   f| ['a,b'] is bounded & ['a,b'] c= dom f;
A2:c <= b & a <= d by A1,XXREAL_0:2; then

     as non empty closed_interval Subset of REAL;
   c = min(c,d) & d = max(c,d) by A1,XXREAL_0:def 9,def 10; then
A5:B c= A by A2,A1,XXREAL_0:2,A4,Lm2;
   then B c= dom(f|A) by A1,RELAT_1:62;
   hence f| ['c,d'] is bounded by A1,A5,Th1915a;

    hence ||. ( (r(#)f)|X )/.x .|| <p by A11,XREAL_1:145;
   end;
   hence thesis;

theorem Th1935b:
  for X be set, f be PartFunc of REAL,the carrier of Z
    st f|X is bounded holds (-f)|X is bounded
proof
   let X be set, f be PartFunc of REAL,the carrier of Z;

theorem Th1914:
  for f be Function of A,the carrier of Z holds

proof
   let f be Function of A,the carrier of Z;
   hereby assume A1: f is bounded;

      .= (f|A).x by FUNCT_1:49,A5
      .= (f|A)/.x by A2,PARTFUN1:def 6,A5;

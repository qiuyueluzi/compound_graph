A2: f.n = y by FUNCT_1:def 3;
    reconsider n as Nat by A1;

A2: len <*c+z*> = 1 by FINSEQ_1:39;
A3: len(c+<*z*>) = len <*z*> by CARD_1:def 7;

A7:   Sum g = Sum p + Sum <*x*> by RVSUM_2:32;
      c+g = (c+p)^(c+<*x*>) by Th3;

theorem
  lim Basel-seq1 = PI^2/6 = lim Basel-seq2
  proof
    lim(p(#)rseq(2,0,2,1)) = p*lim(rseq(2,0,2,1)) by SEQ_2:8;
    hence lim Basel-seq1 = PI^2/6 by Lm17,Lm18,SEQ_2:15;
    lim(p(#)rseq(2,0,2,1)) = p*lim(rseq(2,0,2,1)) by SEQ_2:8;
    hence thesis by Lm17,Lm19,SEQ_2:15;

theorem
  Sum ((sqr x_r-seq(m))") = (2*m+1)^2 / (PI^2) * Sum(Basel-seq,m)

A6: len <*0*> = 1 by FINSEQ_1:39;
A7: F = b/a(#)S
    proof
      thus len(F) = len(S) by A4,A5,A6,A3,FINSEQ_1:def 3

      let k such that

        then S.(0+1) = B.0 by DBLSEQ_2:47;
        hence (b/a(#)S).k = F.k by A1,A10,A11;

A15:    (sqr M).s = (M.s)^2 by VALUED_1:11;
        1-1 < s by A12,XREAL_1:8;

A16:    1 <= s by NAT_1:14;
        s <= m+1-1 by A4,A5,A6,A9,XREAL_1:9;
        then
A17:    M.s = s*PI/(2*m+1) by A16,Th19;
        thus F.k = G.s by A6,A9,A12,FINSEQ_1:24

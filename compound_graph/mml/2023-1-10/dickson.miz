theorem Th1:
  for g being Function, x being set st dom g = {x} holds g = x .--> g.x
proof
  let g be Function, x be set such that
A1: dom g = {x};
  now
    let a,b be object;
A2: dom (x .-->g.x) = {x};
    hereby
      assume
A3:   [a,b] in g;
      then
A4:   a in {x} by A1,FUNCT_1:1;
      then
A5:   a = x by TARSKI:def 1;
      then b = g.x by A3,FUNCT_1:1;
      then (x.-->g.x).a = b by A5,FUNCOP_1:72;
      hence [a,b] in x.-->g.x by A2,A4,FUNCT_1:1;
    end;
    assume
A6: [a,b] in x.-->g.x;
    then

theorem Th2:
  for X being infinite set ex f being sequence of  X st f is one-to-one
proof
  let X be infinite set;
  card NAT c= card X by CARD_3:85;
  then consider f being Function such that
A1: f is one-to-one and
A2: dom f = NAT and
A3: rng f c= X by CARD_1:10;
  for x being object st x in NAT holds f.x in X by A3,A2,FUNCT_1:3;
  then reconsider f as sequence of X by A2,FUNCT_2:3;
  take f;
  thus thesis by A1;
end;

definition
  let R be RelStr, f be sequence of R;
  attr f is ascending means
  for n being Element of NAT
  holds f.(n+1) <> f.n & [f.n, f.(n+1)] in the InternalRel of R;
end;

definition
  let R be RelStr, f be sequence of R;
  attr f is weakly-ascending means
  for n being Nat holds [f.n, f.(n+1)] in the InternalRel of R;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for R being non empty transitive RelStr, f being sequence of R
  st f is weakly-ascending
  for i,j being Nat st i < j holds f.i <= f.j
proof
  let R be non empty transitive RelStr, f be sequence of R such that
A1: f is weakly-ascending;
  let i be Nat;
  defpred P[Nat] means i < $1 implies f.i <= f.$1;
A2: P[ 0 ] by NAT_1:2;
A3: for j being Nat st P[j] holds P[j+1]
  proof
    let j be Nat such that
A4: P[j] and
A5: i < j+1;
    reconsider fj1 = f.(j+1) as Element of R;
A6: [f.j, f.(j+1)] in the InternalRel of R by A1;
    then
A7: f.j <= fj1;
A8: i <= j by A5,NAT_1:13;
    per cases by A8,XXREAL_0:1;
    suppose i < j;
      hence thesis by A4,A7,ORDERS_2:3;
    end;
    suppose i = j;
      hence thesis by A6;
    end;
  end;
  thus for j being Nat holds P[j] from NAT_1:sch 2(A2,A3);
end;

theorem Th4:
  for R being non empty RelStr holds R is connected iff
  the InternalRel of R is_strongly_connected_in the carrier of R
proof
  let R be non empty RelStr;
  set IR = the InternalRel of R, CR = the carrier of R;
  hereby
    assume
A1: R is connected;
    now
      let x, y be object such that
A2:   x in CR and

      reconsider x9=x, y9=y as Element of R by A2,A3;
      x9 <= y9 or y9 <= x9 by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 29;
      hence [x,y] in IR or [y,x] in IR;
    end;
    hence IR is_strongly_connected_in CR;
  end;
  assume IR is_strongly_connected_in CR;
  then for x, y be Element of R holds x <= y or y <= x;
  hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 29;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for L being RelStr, Y being set, a being set
  holds (the InternalRel of L)-Seg(a) misses Y & a in Y iff
  a is_minimal_wrt Y, the InternalRel of L
proof
  let L be RelStr, Y be set, a be set;
  set IR = the InternalRel of L;
  hereby
    assume that
A1: IR-Seg(a) misses Y and
A2: a in Y;

    end;
    hence a is_minimal_wrt Y, IR by A2,WAYBEL_4:def 25;
  end;

  now
    assume not IR-Seg(a) misses Y;

  x being Element of L, a, N being set
  st a is_minimal_wrt (the InternalRel of L)-Seg(x) /\ N,(the InternalRel of L)
  holds a is_minimal_wrt N, (the InternalRel of L)
proof

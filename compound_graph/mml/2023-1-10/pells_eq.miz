begin :: Preliminaries

reserve n,n1,n2,k,D for Nat,
        r,r1,r2 for Real,
        x,y for Integer;

Lm1: 0 < [\ r/] -r +1 <=1
proof
  A1: r-r < [\ r/] +1 -r by INT_1:29, XREAL_1:9;
  [\r/] - r <= r -r by INT_1:def 6, XREAL_1:9;
  then [\r/] - r +1 <= r -r +1 by XREAL_1:6;
  hence thesis by A1;
end;

Lm2:for a,b be Real st a = -b holds |.a.| =|.b.|
proof
  let a,b be Real such that A1: a=-b;
  per cases;
  suppose A2:a <0;
    then b >0 by A1;
    then |.a.| = -a & |.b.| = b by A2,ABSVALUE:def 1;
    hence thesis by A1;
  end;
  suppose a=0;
    hence thesis by A1;
  end;
  suppose A3: a > 0;
    then b < 0 by A1;
    then |. a .| = a & |. b .| = -b by A3, ABSVALUE:def 1;
    hence thesis by A1;
  end;
end;

Lm3:r >0 implies ex n st 1/n < r & n > 1
proof
  assume r>0;
 then consider n be Nat such that
   A1: 1/n < r & n >0 by FRECHET:36;
   n>= 1 by A1,NAT_1:14; then
   A2: n+n > 1+0 by XREAL_1:8;
   n+n > n+0 by A1,XREAL_1:8;
   then 1/(2*n) < 1/n by A1,XREAL_1:76;
   then 1/(2*n) < r by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
   hence thesis by A2;
end;

theorem Th1:
  for i,j be Integer st j < 0 holds j < i mod j <= 0
  proof
    let x,j be Integer;
    assume A1: j < 0;
    then A2: x/j*j = x by XCMPLX_1:87;
    x/j -1 < [\ x/j /] by INT_1:def 6;
    then x/j -1 < (x div j) by INT_1:def 9;
    then (x/j -1)*j > (x div j)*j by A1,XREAL_1:69;
    then x -j > (x div j)*j-0 by A2;
    then x -(x div j)*j > j-0 by XREAL_1:16;
    hence x mod j > j by INT_1:def 10,A1;
    [\ x/j /] <= x/j by INT_1:def 6;
    then (x div j) <= x/j by INT_1:def 9;
    then (x div j)*j >= x/j*j by A1,XREAL_1:65;
    then 0 >= x -(x div j)*j by A2,XREAL_1:47;
    hence x mod j <=0  by INT_1:def 10;
  end;

theorem Th2:
  for i,j be Integer st j <> 0 holds |. i mod j .| < |.j.|
  proof
    let x,j be Integer;
    assume j<>0; then
    per cases;
    suppose j > 0;
      then 0 <= x mod j < j & |.j.|= j by INT_1:57,58,ABSVALUE:def 1;
      hence thesis by ABSVALUE:def 1;
    end;
    suppose j < 0;
      then A2: j < x mod j <= 0 & |.j.| = -j by Th1,ABSVALUE:def 1;
      then |. x mod j .| = -(x mod j) by ABSVALUE:30;
      hence thesis by A2,XREAL_1:24;
    end;
  end;

theorem
  for D be non square Nat
     for p be Element of [:INT,INT:] holds
        p is positive Pell's_solution of D

  thus p is positive Pell's_solution of D
     implies ex n be positive Nat st x + y*S = (t+u*S)|^n
